<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US Macroeconomic Policy Focus</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major catalysts loom next week: January CPI (Feb 13), PPI, and PCE/income spending due in the coming weeks—markets on edge for inflation/labor data given Fed transition risks.</li>
<li>Treasury yields: 10Y trading ~4.2%, curve steepening (10Y-2Y spread now positive ~70bps); FOMC holds line for now, but rate cut expectations swing as February CPI approaches.</li>
<li>Trump administration pushes for aggressive trade policy (“tariffs” and “refundable dividend” schemes), fiscal disputes intensify ahead of budget deadline and possible government shutdown (catalyst window Mar–Apr).</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geopolitics &amp; Energy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US and Iran preparing for backchannel meetings (Oman in focus); Iran rules out halting uranium enrichment, strikes confrontational tone—oil volatility risk elevated with OPEC+, Strait of Hormuz, and Israel/Iran strikes all in play through June.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI, Tech, &amp; Earnings</strong></p>

</li>
</ul>

<h2>Macroeconomic &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>Policy &amp; Fiscal</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates &amp; Fed Path:</strong> Near-term Fed cut now in limbo; FRED data show core CPI cooling (Dec 2025: +1.4% past quarter annualized) but CPI, PPI, and labor data likely to refocus consensus. Market-implied cuts for June rising, but curve flattening could abruptly reverse post–CPI.</li>
<li><strong>Debt, Shutdown, Fiscal Drag:</strong> TBAC refunding and budget proposals expected in March; risk of continuing resolution brinksmanship and technical shutdown in 1–2 months. Catalysts align with tax receipts, Treasury issuance—potential volatility for rate-sensitive sectors and TIPS.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Atlanta and NY Fed GDP “nowcast” estimates point to ongoing real growth above 2% annualized for Q1, consistent with FRED labor force and retail data, but job openings are declining (JOLTS: new lows as of Dec). Recession risk for 2026 persists in market discourse but remains far from base case in fundamental data.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> While market expectations have drifted lower, Jan/Feb CPI prints could upend sentiment if persistent services or shelter inflation surprises. Wage inflation under the surface remains sticky; risk of upside in health, education, or energy components.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Credit, Housing, and Sovereign</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit Market &amp; Ratings:</strong> US downgrade risk remains nontrivial through FY27 budget negotiations and next TBAC (May). Market is increasingly pricing in a “higher for longer” policy regime unless data surprises to the downside.</li>
<li><strong>Housing &amp; Mortgages:</strong> Mortgage rates hovering just above 6%, with expectations for limited further increases unless long-end yields breakout. Case-Shiller data indicate flat-to-down pricing in “tier 2” metros; institutional “landlord” restrictions under policy debate.</li>
<li><strong>Global FX &amp; Sov Debt:</strong> EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and USD/CNH risk volatility spikes tied to Fed/ECB/BoJ policy coordination and pending US–China visit cycle; USD index has softened marginally. External sovereign debt (EU periphery, LATAM) vulnerable to further rating action.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Themes</h2>
<h3>Energy, Commodities, &amp; Inflation Trades</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil/Energy:</strong> Oil spot rallies containable for now (WTI $61–65, FRED); risk builds for major moves if OPEC+ verifies supply cuts or Strait of Hormuz closes (market pricing in ~30–35% probability by late Q2). Uranium and copper both highlighted for looming supply/demand tightness; uranium sentiment aligns with nuclear buildout and licensing event watch.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Hedges:</strong> Second-order effects from new tariff rounds (Trump admin) could reinforce goods inflation mid-year; critical minerals (lithium, copper), ag, and shipping likely to see supply chain disruptions if Pacific or Suez issues emerge.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Green:</strong> EU/US/India on track for climate/energy transition targets (policy debates), yet little near-term upside for US green subsectors—EV and renewables pricing optimism running ahead of implementation evidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology, AI, &amp; Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI/Critical Chips:</strong> AI compute platform deployments (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI) continue to be a core growth story; Nvidia likely to set the sector tone in Q4 print (Feb 19)—any results miss or guidance cut likely to spark a broad tech derisking.</li>
<li><strong>IPO &amp; Funding Flows:</strong> Upround IPO pricing returns across megacaps (SpaceX, Discord, OpenAI, Anthropic); watch for datacenter, cloud security, and AI chip names. Market appears to be discounting the likelihood of $1T+ AI IPOs much more aggressively than private valuations warrant.</li>
<li><strong>Security/Risk:</strong> Cloud and AI vendors under risk of regulatory scrutiny and infrastructure failures. Repeated outages or AI model errors would likely create headline-driven, short-term drawdowns not yet priced in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer, Cyclical, &amp; Defensive</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail &amp; Labor:</strong> Consumer resilience reflected in late-2025 FRED retail sales and jobless claims; labor participation elevated, though job openings continue a shallow downtrend. Fiscal tightening and SNAP benefit policy could hit discretionary consumer earnings by H2.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Labor actions and pandemic tail risks remain underappreciated; hospital system stress, vaccine-preventable disease upticks, and policy flux all add idiosyncratic risks to managed care, pharma, and P&amp;C insurance.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials, Real Assets, Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks/Financials:</strong> System “event risk” notably bid up (bankruptcy, bailout, and fraud tail risks); lender business models sensitive to new rate policy trajectory. Forthcoming Supreme Court, SEC, and FDIC decisions could impact sector profitability, CRE, and regional bank stability.</li>
<li><strong>REITs &amp; Housing:</strong> Residential under pressure; commercial real estate and MBS trade at steeper discounts given sluggish starts and uncertainty over institutional restrictions. Miami/LA/SF home values stagnating as mortgage rates reset; risk is to downside if unemployment prints surprise higher.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Flows to spot ETFs remain positive; volatility and macro-driven rotation risk high. Expect periodic wipeouts in lower quality altcoins; most majors (BTC, ETH, SOL) displaying broad trading ranges into spring. Ethereum catalyst risk centered on ETF, protocol upgrades; regulatory actions (tokenization, custody) remain an X factor.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Notable Names &amp; Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVDA:</strong> Q4 earnings (est. 2/19) are a crucial sentiment bellwether; any signal of order fatigue or AI demand gap will reset multiple growth sector narratives.</li>
<li><strong>AAPL:</strong> Super Bowl presence and product cycle (iPhone 18, MacBook upgrades) play into higher/structural services margin, but broad market risk likely outweighs new product speculation near-term.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA:</strong> Volatility high on quarter-end/EV adoption chatter; robotaxi, Optimus updates near Q1 earnings; risk of short squeezes or drawdowns if delivery or margin disappoints.</li>
<li><strong>OPEN, DASH, CVNA:</strong> Each flagged in bankruptcy/troubled company lists; risk/reward setups now gravitate toward event-driven trades.</li>
<li><strong>Major IPOs:</strong> Discord, SpaceX, OpenAI, Anthropic—high probability for public listings in 2026; market likely to trade ahead of formal filings, so any newsflow will have spillover to QQQ/risk-on proxies.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical &amp; Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Catalysts focus:</strong> Next week’s CPI (Feb 13); Super Bowl commercial and product launches; continued US–Iran/Israel military drama; Supreme Court and Congressional policy signals.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-off triggers:</strong> Government shutdown, big bank event (bailout, forced deal, or insolvency language), Middle East kinetic escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Risk-on triggers:</strong> AI/tech earnings beats, signs of sticky-low inflation in CPI/PPI, or a rapid, coordinated fiscal stimulus bill in FY27 budget.</li>
<li><strong>Long/short pairs or sector rotation:</strong> Stay nimble; rotate between mega-cap tech/AI (earnings/momentum), real assets/inflation trades (commodities, select energy), and domestic US cyclicals with earnings leverage to growth and rates path.</li>
</ul>
