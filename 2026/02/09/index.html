    <h1>Daily Memo (09-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h2>News Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>US Politics &amp; Governance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Major DHS (Homeland Security) funding gridlock continues; government shutdown risk is high as lawmaker negotiations over ICE reforms stall. Democrat and GOP positions are hardening.</li>
<li>GOP criticism of Trump's racially charged social media posts pressures party unity; otherwise, markets and policy risk marginally affected.</li>
<li>White House hosts a governor dinner, excluding Democratic governors, indicating further partisan polarization in DC.</li>
<li>Federal judge orders unsealing of records relating to Georgia election/ballot seizure, reflecting persistent 2020 election legal overhang.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geopolitics, Defense &amp; Middle East</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US tells Iran to return to nuclear talks with real concessions. Iran resists, pledges to maintain uranium enrichment, and rejects military build-up.</li>
<li>Iran escalates crackdown on reformist figures, hardening the regime—a signal of increasing internal risk.</li>
<li>Israel condemns antisemitic violence abroad; Israel-Lebanon and Israel-Gaza cross-border hostilities ongoing.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Asia</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Japan's LDP and PM Sanae Takaichi claim landslide snap election—results drive JPY weakness and strong risk-on rally in Japanese equities; US bond yields rise on spillover effects.</li>

</ul>
</li>

</ul>
</li>

<h2>Macro &amp; Asset Allocation</h2>
<h3>US Rates, Growth &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Macro</strong>: No live data, but last FRED monthly numbers:
<ul>
<li>Core CPI: Mild upward trend end-2025, with December at 331.86. Recent PCE trend similarly elevated but stabilizing.</li>
<li>Unemployment (FRED): Q4 2025 prints at 4.4–4.5%—gradual but not abrupt softening. Jobless claims creeping higher but not at stress levels.</li>
<li>10y–2y yield spread positive, 10y-3m now ~+0.54, indicating a normalized curve but still a low growth risk signal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Short-term</strong>: No imminent recession flagged, though political/budget standoffs are increasing risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation risk</strong>: Market expects January CPI ~2.5–3.0% YoY (next: Feb 13). Higher gas prices (see below) and sticky service inflation keep TIPS and cyclicals relevant.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Credit &amp; Treasury Markets</h3>
<ul>
<li>10-year Treasury yield at 4.21% (recent FRED): bond rally has paused. Some low probability of a March Fed cut—markets now price in a slow, moderate cutting cycle, not high frequency or “emergency” cuts.</li>
<li>March FOMC expected to “hold” rates barring a shutdown-driven economic shock.</li>
<li>Probability of a US credit rating downgrade this year is nontrivial; public debt soon crosses $40T—feeds into volatility in longer-dated bonds and TIPS.</li>
<li>Government shutdown underway (DHS funding unresolved): Expect short-term T-bill volatility, possible risk-off in equities if impasse extends.</li>
</ul>
<h3>FX</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>JPY Weakness</strong>: Snap election landslide for Japanese LDP/PM Takaichi and massive Nikkei rally have spiked USD/JPY past 156; strong carry trade flows, global risk-on.</li>
<li><strong>CNY, EMFX</strong>: Little structural change, but Thai conservative election risk marginally positive for THB stability short-term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Cross-Asset Themes</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<h4>Broad Indices</h4>
<ul>
<li>Futures and option markets see S&amp;P 500 in a wide, volatile range (6300–7300 for coming weeks); market-implied breadth still weak, cyclicals/industrials bid on global upbeat data (Japan/Asia), mega-cap tech trading choppy.</li>
<li>Recession risk in 2026 is low-to-moderate, with risk skewed to a “muddle-through” scenario rather than a hard landing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Rate-Sensitive</h4>
<ul>
<li>Homebuilders/REITs: Headwinds remain—mortgage rates still above 6%, housing starts soft, and new anti-institutional investment bills circulating in Congress.</li>
<li>Banks: Stress to regionals persists, no new insolvencies post-year-end but liquidity and higher funding cost risk linger. Earnings in April are a key catalyst.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Energy/Commodities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Oil: WTI trades $62–65. OPEC+ policy unchanged until June. Iran/Israel/US military entanglement risk remains stubbornly elevated for Q2. Look for further volatility around OPEC+, US foreign action, and US government’s refilling of the SPR.</li>
<li>Gold/Silver: Both are strong in the “sticky inflation + geopolitical” regime. Market pricing for gold end-June range $5,000–$6,000/oz is not outlandish (options skew positive).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Industrials, Materials &amp; Defense</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stronger Japanese/Thai industrial policy and election stability: tailwind to cyclical/industrial-exporters.</li>
<li>Defense stocks remain bid: Israel/Gaza/Lebanon and US/Iran kinetic risk is real (&gt;40% chance for Israel to strike new countries by end-Q2). Cloudflare outperforms given digital risk environment.</li>
<li>Commodities: Minor upward shift in Ag and metals—no major disruptions but copper/uranium bid on new Chinese and energy security policy.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Technology</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tech/AI: NVDA, GOOGL, and &quot;AI infrastructure&quot; stocks rally hard on record Japanese/Asian tech flows and US Super Bowl ads/retail re-engagement.</li>
<li>Apple/Google/Meta/AI: Key product cycle events anticipated through May—AI pin, foldable iPhone hardware, Google AI hardware. Public market wins for ML/AI stocks are likely to be narrative-driven through at least Q2.</li>
<li>Cloud: No negative cloud infra headlines, but regulatory scrutiny will ramp post-IPO season.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Autos/EVs</h4>
<ul>
<li>Tesla &amp; US EVs: Volume growth moderate; product cycle and energy storage are next big headline catalysts (see late Q2 shareholder mtg). No sign Musk out as CEO this year.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Crypto/Alt Assets</h4>
<ul>
<li>BTC mid-$60k range, options market prices both $55k and $80k as plausible scenarios by mid-year.</li>
<li>Strong flows expected in bitcoin ETFs in &amp; around Super Bowl, but volatility remains high—look for regulatory (SEC) announcements and halving headlines to drive the tapes.</li>
<li>Altcoins (ETH, SOL, XRP, LINK): Subdued, with no material outperformance over BTC priced in for February.</li>
<li>Potential for major platform/infra tokens to rally on “safety”/institutional narratives, but regulatory event risk is a wild card.</li>
<li>Measles outbreaks and pandemic chatter not currently affecting cryptomarkets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Political &amp; Geopolitical</h2>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown has started, with no sign of quick resolution—risk of market volatility if prolonged.</li>
<li>US foreign policy direction tense: risk premium on energy/defense sectors justified.</li>
<li>Japan/Asia policy stability, but likely further yen weakness and import-export imbalances.</li>
<li>Ongoing legal, antitrust, and Supreme Court catalysts with real potential to impact big tech (Apple, Amazon, OpenAI, Meta) and regulatory landscape.</li>
<li>Iran faces rising internal risk (political arrests, no sign of regime change yet), underpinning oil/geopolitical market risk premia.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation surprise risks</strong>: CPI (Feb 13) will shape near-term rates/tech leadership. Watch energy/food in CPI/PPI.</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown &amp; Budget</strong>: Each day of a shutdown increases risk of near-term bond volatility and drag on S&amp;P earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Japan global spillover</strong>: Big Japanese election win triggers record equities and higher US yields—a possible early sign of 2026 style cross-border risk-on flows.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Cloud/IPO</strong>: Mega-cap tech multiple expansion still plausible as long as growth holds, but watch for regulatory/M&amp;A headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Defense risk</strong>: Israel, Iran, US, and regional players remain flashpoints; sector continues to benefit from geopolitical tailwind.</li>
<li><strong>Measles/public health</strong>: Monitor for any policy that impacts major employers, insurers, consumer disruptions; currently second-order for equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 13</strong>: January US CPI (inflation)—Direct driver for rates, tech, consumer, TIPS, and growth/value rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 14</strong>: 13F filings (large fund Q4 positions)—Sheds light on crowded/unwind risk in single-name equities and mega-cap tech.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 19</strong>: US PPI release—Confirms inflation trend, especially for cyclicals/materials.</li>
<li><strong>Late Feb/Early Mar</strong>: Q4 2025 GDP 2nd estimate / ISM PMIs—Growth pulse for cyclicals, commodities, and active equity positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 27</strong>: PCE inflation and personal income/spending—Key for Fed signaling and (Big Tech/consumer) equities.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 6</strong>: February nonfarm payrolls, unemployment, wage growth—Labor market health, consumer cyclicals.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 12</strong>: ECB meeting—Impacts EURUSD, European multinationals.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18–19</strong>: FOMC Rate Decision; Mar 19 Powell press conference—Critical for rates, USD, equity risk appetite.</li>
<li><strong>Early May</strong>: Treasury Quarterly Refunding (QRA)—Key for long-duration bonds, yield curve slope, and equity risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>Late March</strong>: Bank of Japan policy—Impacts JPY, global bank/tech rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Q2</strong>: OPEC+ meeting—Oil supply, energy equities, inflation components.</li>
<li><strong>April/May</strong>: US megacap tech/bank earnings—Cash flow, cost of risk, forward multiples set for major indices.</li>
<li><strong>March–May</strong>: GTC (NVIDIA), WWDC (Apple), Tesla annual meeting—AI, product cycles, narrative for Nasdaq/mega-cap growth.</li>
<li><strong>Spring 2026</strong>: CBO Budget/Economic Outlook—Possible downgrade/deficit shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Mid-Year</strong>: Supreme Court term end—Tech, healthcare, and climate litigation with real market impact.</li>
<li><strong>Always-on</strong>: US-China/EU high-level trade talks; major bilateral summits in spring—watch for new tariffs/supply chain restrictions (semiconductors, EVs).</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong>: Key housing (Case-Shiller, new/existing sales)—Read-through for homebuilders, MBS, REITs.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing</strong>: Bitcoin halving narrative, crypto regulatory headlines—Supports volatility, adjacent risk asset sentiment.</li>
