    <h1>Daily Memo (17-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News &amp; Sentiment</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>M&amp;A Activity:</strong> Danaher nears $10B acquisition of Masimo; signals renewed appetite in MedTech consolidation.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Israel strikes in Gaza intensify; Australia refuses repatriation of ISIS-linked citizens from Syria. Tensions remain elevated with a ~52% implied probability of US/Israel kinetic engagement with Iran by June.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Policy:</strong> DHS shutdown appears imminent with high probability of lasting &gt;5 days; Immigration enforcement cooperation with local police skyrocketing.</li>
<li><strong>Market Sentiment:</strong> Nasdaq futures slipping ahead of Nvidia earnings; focus shifting to AI capex sustainability vs. economic deceleration.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Steepening&quot; Slowdown</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Outlook:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a March cut (92% probability of a pause). The consensus has shifted to a &quot;June Cut&quot; baseline.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Curve Signals:</strong> The 10Y-2Y spread has widened to ~0.64 bps (FRED data). This &quot;bull steepening&quot; (short-term rates falling faster than long-term, or long-term rising on issuance/inflation fears while short-term anchors) historically precedes recessionary pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market Cracks:</strong> Unemployment has ticked up to 4.3% (FRED), continuing a slow upward trend. Combined with the DHS shutdown risk, Q1 GDP estimates are fragile.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Implication:</strong> The &quot;higher for longer&quot; narrative is transitioning to &quot;growth scare.&quot; Duration exposure in Treasuries remains attractive as a hedge against a harder landing in Q2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics: The Oil Risk Premium Disconnect</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Setup:</strong> Prediction markets indicate a &gt;50% chance of US/Israel striking Iran by mid-year and continued strikes in Yemen/Somalia.</li>
<li><strong>The Disconnect:</strong> Despite this, WTI crude positioning is bearish, with markets pricing a settlement in the $60-$70 range for February/March.</li>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> The market is overweighting Chinese demand weakness (China Q1 GDP expected &lt;4.5%) and underweighting supply shock risk.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Energy majors and defense primes remain a necessary portfolio hedge. While a DHS shutdown may cause short-term volatility for defense contractors due to payment delays, the secular tailwind of conflict ensures long-term order book growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities &amp; Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tech &amp; AI (Nvidia Earnings):</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Expectation:</strong> Market pricing a 93% chance of an earnings beat. The bar is incredibly high.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> With &quot;Grok 4.20&quot; and Gemini updates imminent, the capex cycle is intact, but execution risk is high. A &quot;beat and raise&quot; is required to maintain current multiples.</li>
<li><strong>Rotation:</strong> If Nvidia falters, expect capital rotation out of semis into software (Salesforce, Workday expected to beat) or defensive sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Discretionary:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divergence:</strong> Walmart expected to beat (value/staple resilience) while discretionary names like Etsy face headwinds. The consumer is trading down, not stopping.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Danaher/Masimo deal puts a floor under MedTech valuations. Labcorp and Hims &amp; Hers expected to beat earnings, highlighting strength in diagnostics and direct-to-consumer health.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Price action consolidating between $60k-$64k. Markets pricing a higher probability of a dip to $50k by year-end than a rally to $100k in the short term.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Headwinds:</strong> High probability of stablecoin regulation or enforcement actions in 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Short-term volatility likely around the FOMC minutes and Nvidia earnings (correlation remains high). Long-term holders should watch for the &quot;Kimchi Premium&quot; (Korea) as a leading indicator of retail froth.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 18 (Tomorrow):</strong> <strong>Nvidia (NVDA) Earnings Release.</strong> <em>The primary directional driver for the Nasdaq 100 and AI sentiment.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 20:</strong> <strong>Supreme Court Ruling on Tariffs.</strong> <em>High impact on Industrials, Retail, and Inflation expectations if executive tariff powers are upheld/struck down.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 26:</strong> <strong>Q4 2025 U.S. GDP (2nd Estimate).</strong> <em>Critical for confirming if the &quot;soft landing&quot; remains on track.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> <strong>DHS Funding Deadline.</strong> <em>High probability of partial government shutdown; negative for short-term sentiment and government contractors.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 6:</strong> <strong>February Employment Situation.</strong> <em>Key metric for the Fed's June rate cut decision; look for unemployment ticking &gt;4.4%.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> <strong>February CPI Release.</strong> <em>Will confirm if January's inflation uptick was noise or a trend.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> <strong>FOMC Meeting &amp; Dot Plot.</strong> <em>Expectation is a Hold; the Dot Plot will dictate the 2H 2026 yield curve.</em></li>
