<hr />
<h3>Investment Thesis &amp; Guidelines</h3>
<h4>1. Macro: The &quot;Higher for Longer&quot; Reality Check</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a March rate cut (&gt;97% probability of a pause). The consensus has shifted toward a mid-year (June/July) pivot.
<ul>
<li><em>Implication:</em> Short-duration yields remain attractive. Equity valuations may face headwinds if the 10Y Treasury yield breaks above resistance (currently ~4.05%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Growth:</strong> FRED data indicates Core CPI remains sticky (~332.8 index level) while unemployment is stable (4.3%).
<ul>
<li><em>2nd Order Effect:</em> Sticky inflation combined with a resilient labor market gives the Fed cover to hold rates. This creates a ceiling for valuation expansion in non-profitable tech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Geopolitics: The Iran Risk Premium</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation:</strong> Prediction markets are pricing a significant probability (~50-60%) of a US or Israeli strike on Iran by late March.
<ul>
<li><em>Trade:</em> Long Energy (Oil futures/Equities) acts as a necessary hedge here. An escalation would spike crude prices, complicating the disinflation narrative.</li>
<li><em>Defense:</em> Continued conflict in Ukraine and rising Middle East tensions reinforce the long thesis for Defense primes and contractors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine/Russia:</strong> Peace talks appear unlikely in Q1. Russian territorial gains in the Donbas region are accelerating.
<ul>
<li><em>Impact:</em> Continued demand for munitions and land systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Sector Focus</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> IPO speculation is intensifying with valuations projected &gt;$1T. Watch for pre-IPO allocation opportunities or exposure via publicly traded suppliers/partners.</li>
<li><strong>Anduril:</strong> High probability of government stake/contracts suggests continued disruption of legacy primes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Technology &amp; AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple ($AAPL):</strong> NATO security clearance for devices is a bullish B2G (Business-to-Government) signal, opening high-security enterprise markets.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> H100 index pricing suggests sustained demand, though volatility is expected around upcoming earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media:</strong> Regulatory risk is rising (addiction trials). Monitor $META for legal liability pricing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medicaid Freeze:</strong> The Minnesota moratorium suggests a hostile federal environment for insurers reliant on government programs. Exercise caution with Medicaid-heavy managed care organizations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Consolidating in the $60k-$70k range. Markets remain bullish on year-end targets ($100k+), but short-term volatility is expected.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Remains a strong hold. It serves as a dual hedge against both geopolitical escalation (Iran) and potential fiscal instability (US debt concerns).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
