    <h1>Daily Memo (28-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Escalation:</strong> The US and Israel have launched major combat operations against Iran, targeting Tehran and military infrastructure. Airspace across the Middle East (Iran, Israel, Iraq, Jordan) is largely closed.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Policy:</strong> The Supreme Court blocked Trump’s latest tariff push, though the administration signals a workaround strategy is in development.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Sentiment:</strong> Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated markets have &quot;got it wrong&quot; regarding AI's threat to software stocks, arguing compute spend will drive software revenues.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate Moves:</strong> CoreWeave stock plummeted following earnings and concerns over capital expenditure plans.</li>
<li><strong>Aviation:</strong> The FAA is mandating flight reductions at Chicago O'Hare for the summer, signaling capacity constraints.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Investment Thesis: War Risk &amp; Inflationary Shocks</h3>
<p><strong>Macroeconomic Outlook</strong>
The immediate investment landscape is dominated by the outbreak of direct conflict between the US/Israel and Iran. While the FRED data indicates a cooling labor market (4.3% unemployment) and steady rates (Fed Funds ~3.64%), the geopolitical shock threatens to unanchor inflation expectations via energy prices.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inflation Risk:</strong> WTI Crude has been hovering in the mid-$60s but is primed for a violent repricing upwards. If the Strait of Hormuz is threatened—a scenario markets are pricing with increasing concern—expect a rapid spike in CPI inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Trajectory:</strong> Markets strongly favor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair. His nomination would typically signal a pro-market, deregulatory stance, but the immediate war footing complicates the rate cut path. The Fed may be forced to hold rates higher for longer if oil spikes, despite the cooling economy.</li>
<li><strong>Flight to Safety:</strong> Expect capital rotation out of high-beta consumer discretionary names and into Treasuries ($TLT), Gold, and the Dollar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Geopolitical Risk: Middle East</strong>
The conflict has moved from proxy skirmishes to direct state-on-state engagement.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy Supply:</strong> The primary risk is a retaliatory closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Markets are currently pricing in significant disruptions to LNG and crude flows.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Spending:</strong> Continued and expanded conflict ensures long-term order book growth for major defense prime contractors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector &amp; Asset Class Guidelines</h3>
<p><strong>Energy &amp; Commodities ($XLE, $DBC)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil &amp; Gas:</strong> Aggressively overweight. The conflict in Iran puts global supply at immediate risk. Look for upstream producers with low debt who can capitalize on spot price spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Bullish. Gold is acting as the primary hedge against both geopolitical instability and the potential debasement of fiat currencies if the US monetizes war debt.</li>
<li><strong>Uranium:</strong> Markets indicate a resurgence in nuclear energy interest; miners remain a high-beta play on energy independence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace ($XAR)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contractors:</strong> The &quot;major combat operations&quot; announcement is a direct catalyst for munitions and systems manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> IPO anticipation is building for mid-to-late 2026. This sentiment spills over into publicly traded aerospace suppliers and satellite connectivity firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI ($QQQ)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Nvidia remains the bellwether. Despite the CEO's bullishness on software, the sector faces headwinds from potential supply chain disruptions in Asia if the conflict widens.</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> CoreWeave's drop highlights investor fatigue with high-capex AI infrastructure plays without immediate ROI. However, Jensen Huang's comments suggest a potential buying opportunity in beaten-down enterprise software names ($IGV) that leverage AI.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Approaching a product cycle event (March 4). Expectations are high for &quot;Apple Intelligence&quot; integration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto ($BTC, $ETH)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Currently trading near $60k-$64k. Sentiment suggests Bitcoin may outperform Gold in the short term as a &quot;digital flight to safety,&quot; though it remains correlated with risk assets during acute liquidity crunches.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> Network upgrades are on the horizon, but price action remains secondary to Bitcoin's dominance during geopolitical stress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Watch List &amp; Specific Exposures</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long:</strong> Defense primes, Oil majors, Gold, Cybersecurity (critical infrastructure protection).</li>
<li><strong>Short/Avoid:</strong> Airlines (airspace closures + rising jet fuel costs), Consumer Discretionary (inflation pinch), highly leveraged AI infrastructure plays.</li>
<li><strong>Specific Tickers:</strong> Monitor <strong>Tesla</strong> (Musk's political involvement/Texas network), <strong>Nvidia</strong> (software commentary), and <strong>Apple</strong> (upcoming event).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
