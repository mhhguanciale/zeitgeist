    <h1>Daily Memo (21-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Severe Weather:</strong> A major Nor'easter is tracking toward the Northeast (Boston, Philly, NYC) with potential blizzard conditions expected Sunday/Monday. Expect disruptions to travel, retail foot traffic, and potential insurance claims.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Japan PM Takaichi has vowed a security overhaul citing &quot;coercion&quot; from China, signaling increased defense spending in the APAC region.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Policy:</strong> The EPA is weakening limits on mercury from coal plants, a regulatory tailwind for coal operators and legacy utilities, though a headwind for clean energy sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Rivalry:</strong> Tensions between OpenAI and Anthropic leadership were visible at a recent summit, highlighting the intensifying race for AI dominance as model releases approach.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Warsh Pivot&quot; &amp; The June Cut Narrative</h3>
<p>Current data suggests the Federal Reserve is locked into a &quot;higher for longer&quot; stance through Q1, but the narrative is shifting toward a mid-year easing cycle driven by personnel changes rather than immediate data deterioration.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Chair Transition:</strong> Markets are pricing a ~94% probability of Kevin Warsh being nominated as the next Fed Chair. This signals a potential shift toward a more market-sensitive, potentially politically aligned monetary policy later in 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Rate Path:</strong> With the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 4.08% and unemployment steady at 4.3%, the probability of a March rate cut has collapsed to ~5.5%. However, the probability of a cut by the June meeting sits at ~68%.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Implication:</strong> The &quot;no landing&quot; scenario is the consensus for Q1. Avoid aggressive duration bets ($ZROZ/TLT) until yields test the 4.25%-4.4% range. Focus on quality equities that can withstand 4% yields for another quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Energy: The Mispriced Risk Premium</h3>
<p>There is a significant dislocation between geopolitical event probabilities and current energy prices. WTI Crude is trading softly at ~$62.50, pricing in a surplus/demand weakness scenario, while ignoring looming supply shocks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran Escalation:</strong> Implied probabilities for a US or Israeli strike on Iran by June 30, 2026, have risen to ~67%. Despite this, oil volatility remains suppressed.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Spending:</strong> Japan's security overhaul and the high probability of continued conflict in Eastern Europe support a structural long position in the Defense sector ($XAR).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Implication:</strong> Energy ($XLE, $DBC) offers an asymmetric risk/reward profile here. The market is underpricing the risk of a kinetic event in the Persian Gulf by Q2. Accumulate energy majors and defense contractors on current weakness.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Focus: Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<p>The AI trade is entering a &quot;show me&quot; phase for software but remains a hardware super-cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Release Cycle:</strong> There is an ~82% implied probability of GPT-5.3 being released by March 31. This is a massive near-term catalyst for Microsoft ($MSFT) and the broader AI software ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Nvidia ($NVDA) earnings expectations are sky-high (90% implied beat probability). While the trade is crowded, the release of next-gen models (GPT-5.3, Claude 5) necessitates continued capex spend by hyperscalers.</li>
<li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Apple ($AAPL) is unlikely to announce the iPhone 17e in February, pushing hardware catalysts to the March/April window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Hedges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Northeast Blizzard:</strong> Short-term tactical shorts on insurers ($KIE) and airlines ($JETS) may be profitable as flight cancellations and claims spike over the weekend.</li>
<li><strong>Public Health:</strong> Rising measles cases in the US (Utah, Virginia) are garnering attention. While not a systemic risk yet, watch vaccine manufacturers ($MRK, $GSK) for sentiment shifts.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 22-24 (Immediate):</strong> Northeast Blizzard impact on travel/retail data.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 4 (Est):</strong> Potential Apple NYC Event (watch for AI integration announcements).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 6:</strong> US February Jobs Report (Key for confirming the &quot;no landing&quot; thesis).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> US February CPI Print (Inflation stickiness check).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> FOMC Meeting &amp; Rate Decision (Expect pause, watch Dot Plot for June signal).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 31:</strong> Deadline window for GPT-5.3 release (Major AI volatility event).</li>
<li><strong>Apr 2026:</strong> Q1 Earnings Season begins (Banks lead).</li>
<li><strong>June 2026:</strong> High-probability window for potential escalation in Iran/Middle East.</li>
</ul>
