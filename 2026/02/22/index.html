    <h1>Daily Memo (22-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>News Brief</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Russia launched major missile/drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure; Kyiv pounded ahead of invasion anniversary. Iran facing renewed anti-regime student protests.</li>
<li><strong>US Policy:</strong> Trump advisor Kevin Hassett criticized Fed researchers regarding tariff impact reports, signaling potential Executive-Fed friction. Trump approved emergency declaration for DC sewage spill.</li>
<li><strong>Weather:</strong> Major winter storm impacting East Coast/NYC; potential short-term disruption to travel and retail foot traffic.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> Hims &amp; Hers ($HIMS) facing scrutiny over compounded weight loss drugs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro &amp; Policy: The Pause &amp; The Shutdown</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Outlook:</strong> Markets have effectively priced in a <strong>Pause</strong> for the March FOMC meeting (&gt;95% implied probability). Attention has shifted to a potential cut in June.
<ul>
<li><em>Context:</em> Recent FRED data shows Core CPI trending upward (332.8) and Unemployment stabilizing ~4.3-4.4%. The &quot;sticky inflation&quot; narrative supports the pause thesis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Drag:</strong> High probability (&gt;90%) of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shutdown starting late February, with prediction markets pricing a duration of <strong>&gt;10 days</strong>.
<ul>
<li><em>Impact:</em> Short-term volatility in government services and potential sentiment hit for defense/border security contractors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Yield Curve:</strong> The 10Y/2Y spread is widening (steepening). With the 10Y hovering ~4.08%, markets are sniffing out long-term fiscal expansion or persistent inflation rather than immediate recession.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics &amp; Energy: Escalation Risks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Probability of US or Israel striking Iran by mid-2026 is rising in betting markets. Immediate focus is on potential strikes in Lebanon/Gaza this week.
<ul>
<li><em>Trade:</em> <strong>$XLE</strong> (Energy) and <strong>$XAR</strong> (Defense) remain primary hedges against this tail risk.</li>
<li><em>Oil:</em> WTI holding ~$62.50. While markets predict range-bound action ($60-$70) for Feb close, the geopolitical premium is arguably underpriced given the &quot;foreign intervention&quot; signals in Gaza.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Eastern Europe:</strong> High confidence in Russia capturing key strategic towns (Rodynske, Hryshyne) by end of Q1 2026.
<ul>
<li><em>Impact:</em> Continued pressure on global energy supply chains and sustained demand for US defense exports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Uranium:</strong> Bullish sentiment persisting; markets pricing Uranium to hold &gt;$100/lbs levels, supporting the nuclear energy thesis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities &amp; Tech: Earnings &amp; Product Cycles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors ($SOXX / $NVDA):</strong> High conviction (&gt;85%) that <strong>NVIDIA</strong> will beat quarterly earnings. Markets are positioning for NVDA to potentially reclaim &quot;largest company by market cap&quot; status from Apple/Microsoft in the short term.</li>
<li><strong>Apple ($AAPL):</strong> Major catalyst approaching with the March 4th NYC event.
<ul>
<li><em>Expectations:</em> High probability of &quot;M5&quot; chip announcement and iPad refresh. &quot;iPhone 17e&quot; announcement less likely but possible.</li>
<li><em>Trade:</em> Watch for &quot;sell the news&quot; pressure post-event if AI integration details are vague.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Beats:</strong> Prediction markets show high confidence (&gt;80%) in earnings beats for <strong>Salesforce ($CRM)</strong>, <strong>CrowdStrike ($CRWD)</strong>, <strong>Workday ($WDAY)</strong>, and <strong>Broadcom ($AVGO)</strong>.
<ul>
<li><em>Contrast:</em> Lower confidence/mixed signals for consumer discretionary names like <strong>Lowe's ($LOW)</strong> and <strong>Target ($TGT)</strong>, reflecting the soft consumer sentiment data (Michigan Sentiment ~56.4).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin ($BTC):</strong> Sentiment remains bullish with price targets of $90k-$100k active for 2026. ETF flows expected to remain positive.</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum ($ETH):</strong> Markets pricing in a floor above $2,000 for end of Feb, with upside volatility expected.</li>
<li><strong>Gold ($IAU):</strong> Strong safe-haven bid. Markets pricing settlement &gt;$2,600/oz, driven by the geopolitical instability noted above.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 23 (Week of):</strong> Major Crypto ETF flow reports (BTC/ETH).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 27:</strong> January 2026 Core PCE Inflation Release (Fed's preferred metric).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> <strong>CRITICAL:</strong> US Government Funding Deadline / Potential DHS Shutdown start.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 4:</strong> <strong>Apple ($AAPL) NYC Product Event</strong> (M5 Chip/iPad).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 6:</strong> February 2026 Employment Situation (NFP/Unemployment).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 12:</strong> February 2026 CPI Inflation Release.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> FOMC Meeting &amp; Economic Projections (Dot Plot).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 31:</strong> Deadline for potential new US Tariffs on China/Mexico.</li>
