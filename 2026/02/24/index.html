    <h1>Daily Memo (24-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mexico Security Crisis:</strong> Mexican forces raided a cartel stronghold to track &quot;El Mencho&quot;; US Embassy issued security alerts. High risk of retaliatory violence impacting tourism and cross-border logistics.</li>
<li><strong>Iran Strike Risk:</strong> Trump’s top general warned of acute risks in attacking Iran, though reports suggest Trump is frustrated with limited military options.</li>
<li><strong>DHS Shutdown:</strong> Ex-ICE instructor testimony on &quot;defective&quot; training coincides with a looming DHS shutdown; prediction markets price a &gt;98% chance the shutdown lasts 14+ days.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Sentiment:</strong> Asian markets tracking US lower on AI anxieties; Jamie Dimon downplayed AI risks to JPMorgan but warned of &quot;lofty asset prices.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The Tariff-Shutdown Squeeze</h3>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Trade Policy:</strong>
The immediate macro environment is defined by two converging headwinds: a high-probability DHS shutdown and the implementation of blanket tariffs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tariff Shock:</strong> Prediction markets assign a ~99% probability to a new 10% US blanket tariff going into effect by Feb 28. This is a direct inflationary impulse not fully priced into the short end of the curve.</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown Drag:</strong> Markets anticipate the DHS shutdown extending beyond two weeks. While defense appropriations often pass, the specific targeting of Homeland Security creates friction for border logistics and travel throughput (TSA).</li>
<li><strong>Fed Outlook:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a March rate cut (&lt;4% probability), shifting the baseline to a &quot;skip&quot; in March with cuts beginning in June (67% probability). With Kevin Warsh the presumptive nominee for Fed Chair (94%), expect a hawkish tilt to future guidance, potentially capping the upside on long-duration Treasuries despite the shutdown-induced growth drag.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actionable Theme:</strong> Long volatility in FX (USD pairs) and short-duration fixed income. The tariff implementation is a hard catalyst for USD strength against export-heavy currencies (CNY, MXN).</p>
<h3>Geopolitics: The Iran Divergence</h3>
<p>There is a massive dislocation between prediction markets and standard equity volatility regarding Iran.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Signal:</strong> Prediction markets are pricing a ~60-70% probability of a US or Israeli strike on Iran by the end of Q1 2026. News flow indicates hesitation from military brass, but political pressure is mounting.</li>
<li><strong>The Trade:</strong> Oil markets (WTI ~$62.50) appear complacent. If the prediction markets are correct, the risk premium in energy is severely underpriced.</li>
<li><strong>Second Order Effect:</strong> A strike would likely trigger asymmetric warfare affecting the Strait of Hormuz. Defense primes and shipping logistics firms are the natural hedge here.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> IPO speculation is intensifying, with markets pricing a ~65% chance of a June 2026 listing. Valuation expectations are settling &gt;$1T.</li>
<li><strong>Traditional Defense:</strong> With the DHS shutdown looming and Ukraine entering its 4th year of conflict (Russia making incremental gains in Pokrovskoe/Lyman), ammunition and drone manufacturing remain critical.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hardware Cycle:</strong> NVIDIA earnings are expected to beat (94% probability). The focus is shifting to the next generation of consumer hardware.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Markets are pricing a 47% chance of OpenAI announcing headphones/earbuds in 2026. This signals a pivot from pure LLM software to consumer hardware, potentially putting them in direct competition with Apple and Meta.</li>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> High probability (&gt;95%) of an iPhone 17e announcement by mid-March.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emerging Markets (Mexico)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cartel Risk:</strong> The raid on &quot;El Mencho&quot; combined with the potential for US anti-cartel operations on foreign soil (20% probability by March 31) creates significant tail risk for Mexican equities and the Peso. Supply chains for US autos and electronics manufacturing in Jalisco/Guadalajara are vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Price action is consolidating between $60k-$64k. Markets lean bullish for end-of-month performance.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory:</strong> High probability of a 10% tariff implementation may drive capital flight into non-sovereign stores of value.</li>
<li><strong>XRP:</strong> Strong sentiment holding above $1.00, with markets pricing a move toward $1.30+ in the short term.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>

<li><strong>Feb 27, 2026:</strong> January 2026 US PCE inflation (Fed's preferred metric).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28, 2026:</strong> <strong>Critical Deadline:</strong> New 10% US blanket tariff expected to go into effect.</li>
