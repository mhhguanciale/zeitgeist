    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Feb-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Bullets (Market-Relevant)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Middle East: Pentagon preparing a second carrier deployment; Trump-Netanyahu talks emphasize “deal with Iran vs war.” Oil still in low–mid $60s (WTI), but military footprint is rising.</li>
<li>US politics: House passes Trump-backed SAVE America Act (strict voter ID), intensifying polarization risk into 2026 midterm cycle.</li>
<li>Labor/education: San Francisco teachers strike closes schools, adding to evidence of public-sector wage pressure and service disruptions.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity: Microsoft patches multiple actively exploited zero-days; new “ZeroDayRAT” spyware compromises iOS/Android. Elevated cyber spending tailwind for security/software.</li>
<li>Health: Growing measles outbreaks in SC and FL campuses; AMA launching independent vaccine-effectiveness review process, partly filling perceived CDC trust gap.</li>
<li>Crypto: Susquehanna-backed BlockFills halts withdrawals, another stress event in crypto credit intermediation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Growth / Inflation Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI index rose steadily through Dec-2025 (Mar: 325.7 → Dec: 331.9) and core PCE similarly ticked up (Feb: 125.1 → Nov: 127.4). Inflation trend is disinflating but sticky, not deflationary.</li>
<li>Real activity:
<ul>
<li>Nonfarm payrolls essentially flat but positive through 2025, rising modestly into Jan-2026 (≈+140k from Apr-25 to Jan-26). No sign of a sharp slowdown.</li>
<li>Unemployment has drifted up but is stable (4.2–4.5% range, Jan-26 at 4.3%).</li>
<li>JOLTS openings falling from ~7.7M in mid-2025 to ~6.5M in Dec-2025: labor market cooling, but from tight levels.</li>
<li>Industrial production and retail sales both grinding higher into year-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Yield curve:
<ul>
<li>2Y ~3.5%, 10Y ~4.2%; curve steepened back to a positive 10Y–2Y spread (~0.7%) and 10Y–3M (~0.5%). Classic post-inversion normalization consistent with “late-cycle / early-mid expansion,” not imminent recession.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financial conditions: Chicago Fed index around -0.56, i.e., loose and slowly easing further.</li>
<li>Fed: Effective fed funds down from 4.33% (spring 2025) to 3.64% (Jan 2026), confirming a nascent easing cycle already underway.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Takeaways / Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Markets and current data both point to positive 2026 growth with low odds of outright recession this year.
<ul>
<li>Aligns with very low odds priced for negative 2025 GDP: equities remain supported by macro, dips likely more valuation- and sentiment-driven than fundamental.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For US duration:
<ul>
<li>With curves positive but modestly so, long duration remains a convex bet on any growth or geopolitical shock (Middle East, Taiwan, Ukraine) that drives a risk-off rally.</li>
<li>Near-term CPI/PPI/PCE prints are the main risk to a “steady easing” path; the data so far justifies gradual, not aggressive, cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Policy &amp; Politics</h2>
<h3>US Fiscal and Tax Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets price:
<ul>
<li>Very high odds that 2025 sees <strong>small</strong> or minimal net budget cuts and that an aggressive 5–10% federal budget cut is very unlikely.</li>
<li>High likelihood that <strong>tax revenues remain structurally high</strong> (low probability of revenue collapse; the “&lt; $100b revenue” scenario is effectively impossible under current code and GDP).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combined with:
<ul>
<li>Fed already easing and financial conditions loose.</li>
<li>No near-term debt ceiling drama.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal impulse remains roughly neutral to mildly supportive, not strongly contractionary:
<ul>
<li>Constructive for cyclicals, credit, and broad indices.</li>
<li>Reduces tail risk of a 2025–26 austerity-induced recession.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deficits and sustained issuance still argue for:
<ul>
<li>A structurally higher term premium vs the 2010s (10Y anchored around 4% rather than 2–3%).</li>
<li>Preference for barbell across cash/short duration + some long duration for convexity, vs heavy concentration in the 5–10y sector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>US Politics: Trump Administration Stability &amp; Midterm Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets see:
<ul>
<li>Non-trivial risk Trump is out or otherwise removed before late-decade (impeachment/resignation probabilities low individually but not negligible when combined).</li>
<li>2026 midterm base case: <strong>Republican Senate, Democratic House</strong> is marginally favored; unified party control in either direction is less likely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>House’s SAVE America Act (strict voter ID) passage:
<ul>
<li>Increases election litigation risk and social tension.</li>
<li>Potential for court challenges and further SCOTUS involvement (overlapping with term-end rulings, late June).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline: divided government after 2026</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Large structural changes to tax rates, healthcare, or climate policy are less likely; incrementalism and executive action dominate.</li>
<li>This tends to support higher multiples (policy gridlock premium) but caps upside from pro-growth reforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tail events (Trump impeachment/resignation, stronger GOP control)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>If realized, could reopen corporate tax-cut narratives and deregulation themes (financials, energy, small-cap cyclicals).</li>
<li>But the very act of instability would bring near-term volatility, likely favoring quality, low-leverage names and Treasuries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Immigration &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets assign:
<ul>
<li>High odds of <strong>moderate deportation</strong> volumes (hundreds of thousands) but low odds of <strong>extreme mass deportation</strong> (750k+ in 2025).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2nd/3rd order effects:
<ul>
<li>Sectors with high undocumented labor exposure—agriculture, low-end construction, hospitality, certain logistics segments—face wage and disruption risk even under “moderate” enforcement.</li>
<li>Housing:
<ul>
<li>Reduced household formation at the margin in immigrant-heavy regions; slight downward pressure on rents in select MSAs but persistent supply constraints remain.</li>
<li>Labor tightness in construction can offset demand drag via slower housing supply, keeping price floors intact despite flat Case-Shiller index in 2025.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Underweight:
<ul>
<li>Pure-play labor-intensive, low-margin service firms with high undocumented-labor reliance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neutral/slightly positive:
<ul>
<li>Residential REITs nationally; regional differentiation matters more than national averages.</li>
<li>Automation beneficiaries (industrial robotics, warehouse automation, ag-tech) gain from tighter low-skill labor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Geopolitics &amp; Commodities</h2>
<h3>Russia–Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets see:
<ul>
<li>Very low odds of a ceasefire by 1H-2026, but a <strong>plausible chance of some settlement by end-2026</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Short term:
<ul>
<li>Stalemate pricing continues: modest upside support for defense, limited incremental impact on energy given already-adjusted flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medium term:
<ul>
<li>A later-2026 ceasefire would:
<ul>
<li>Pressure European gas and some oil premia lower over time.</li>
<li>Support EU cyclicals and EM Europe assets.</li>
<li>Slightly reduce global defense-spend growth rates off a higher base.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Near term: maintain overweight to defense/aerospace; conflict duration is the base case.</li>
<li>For commodities:
<ul>
<li>With WTI in low–mid $60s and no imminent ceasefire, current levels are consistent with a balanced but fragile supply-demand picture.</li>
<li>Optionality via commodity producers remains useful hedging for geopolitical shock (Russia, Middle East, Taiwan).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Middle East / Iran &amp; Israel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Newsflow:
<ul>
<li>Second US carrier poised for deployment; Trump publicly prefers talks but threatens “something very tough” if demands unmet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Markets do not show (from oil) a large war premium yet; WTI in low $60s suggests complacency.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short term:
<ul>
<li>Skew is to <strong>upside risk</strong> in crude and products if talks fail or if there is any direct Iran–US/Israel confrontation (shipping, infrastructure).</li>
<li>Airline, shipping, and EM importers vulnerable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medium term:
<ul>
<li>A negotiated framework with Iran reduces tail risk and keeps oil capped, favoring:
<ul>
<li>Refiners (if margins hold).</li>
<li>Consumer discretionary via lower energy burden.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain:
<ul>
<li>Some exposure to quality energy producers and diversified commodities as cheap geopolitical insurance.</li>
<li>Avoid heavy leverage to fuel-intensive industries without hedges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>China / Taiwan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets:
<ul>
<li>Short-term invasion by end-2026 is viewed as low probability, but <strong>over the longer indeterminate horizon</strong> the risk is perceived non-trivial (as indicated by non-negligible pricing in vague “before GTA VI” style timelines).</li>
<li>Xi Jinping removal before 2027 seen as unlikely; continuity is base case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implications for semis:
<ul>
<li>Supply chain diversification to US, Europe, and other Asian countries continues as a <strong>structural theme</strong>, even absent conflict.</li>
<li>Capex cycle for advanced foundry and packaging likely remains strong; geopolitical risk premium keeps valuations for some Taiwan-centric names discounted vs US/Europe peers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Non-Taiwan-based advanced logic and packaging exposure.</li>
<li>Equipment vendors that benefit regardless of fab location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Be cautious:
<ul>
<li>Direct, single-jurisdiction exposure to Taiwan manufacturing and Chinese ADRs with heavy US export-dependency; these remain hostage to sanctions/tariff headlines even if hot conflict never materializes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Sectors</h2>
<h3>Defense &amp; Cybersecurity</h3>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitics: Russia-Ukraine stalemate, Middle East carrier deployment, Taiwan risk all support structurally higher defense outlays.</li>
<li>Cyber:
<ul>
<li>Active exploitation of Microsoft zero-days and ZeroDayRAT on mobile reaffirm cyber as a <strong>nondiscretionary Opex item</strong> for enterprises and governments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Overweight:
<ul>
<li>Defense primes and select subsystem suppliers with strong FCF and backlog visibility.</li>
<li>Cybersecurity platforms and endpoint/network security vendors; upside from elevated threat landscape and regulatory scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>Apple’s Siri delays:
<ul>
<li>Reinforces that traditional handset OEMs may lag in frontier AI, keeping the center of gravity with hyperscalers and leading model providers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI hardware:
<ul>
<li>Very low expectations for near-term consumer hardware launches from leading AI players.</li>
<li>AI monetization remains <strong>software and cloud-centric</strong> in the 1–3 year window, not devices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain bias to:
<ul>
<li>Mega-cap cloud and AI infrastructure names (GPUs, networking, data center REITs/infrastructure) vs speculative consumer AI hardware plays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For semis:
<ul>
<li>Structural AI demand + supply-chain diversification vs cyclicality; late-cycle macro is a risk but core AI leaders remain in secular growth.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare &amp; Public Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measles outbreaks and AMA independent vaccine-review effort:
<ul>
<li>Highlights ongoing polarization over public health guidance.</li>
<li>Raises odds of <strong>state-level mandates or funding shifts</strong>, but not immediate national policy overhaul.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Impacts:
<ul>
<li>Near term: modest volume benefit for vaccine makers, diagnostics, and public-health IT.</li>
<li>Medium term: if non-governmental reviews increase confidence, could stabilize uptake, benefiting established vaccine franchises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Selectively positive on:
<ul>
<li>Large-cap diversified pharma and vaccine players.</li>
<li>Public-health infrastructure and data/IT.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Services</h3>
<ul>
<li>McDonald’s earnings:
<ul>
<li>Strong performance from value-focused strategy and promotions: suggests <strong>trade-down but still resilient spending</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macro backdrop:
<ul>
<li>Consumer sentiment low but off the bottom; real incomes supported by easing inflation and Fed cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Education strikes:
<ul>
<li>Localized but indicative of wage-pressure risk in public services, feeding into municipal budgets and longer-term tax debates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Value-oriented QSR, discounters, and staples with pricing power over premium discretionary exposed to middle-/lower-income stress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Neutral:
<ul>
<li>Broad retail given flat but steady retail sales and lack of severe labor deterioration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternative Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets assign:
<ul>
<li>Roughly balanced views on extreme BTC upside to $1M on an indefinite horizon, which is consistent with <strong>heavy tail optionality but not base case</strong>.</li>
<li>Niche token events (e.g., MegaETH launch/airdrop) have decent odds of near-term speculative flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BlockFills halting withdrawals:
<ul>
<li>Reiterates <strong>ongoing counterparty and leverage risks</strong> within crypto credit and CeFi.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Macro:
<ul>
<li>Fed easing, positive yield curve, and loose financial conditions support speculative appetite but also reduce the immediate “fiat debasement” narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treat crypto as:
<ul>
<li>A high-volatility, asymmetric sleeve, size-constrained within the overall portfolio.</li>
<li>Focus on most liquid, top-tier protocols rather than credit-intermediated yield plays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid:
<ul>
<li>Overexposure to opaque lenders or platforms offering high yields funded by directional risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. Cross-Asset Strategy Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Equities (US)</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Macro data + policy trajectory favor continued support for broad indices.</li>
<li>Relative tilts:
<ul>
<li>Overweight: defense/cyber, AI/cloud, select semis (ex-Taiwan concentrated risk), value QSR/discount retail, quality energy.</li>
<li>Underweight: labor-intensive low-margin services, highly levered consumer cyclicals without pricing power, single-point China/Taiwan political risk exposures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rates / Bonds</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Fed easing path + positive but modest curve steepness:
<ul>
<li>Maintain barbell (short + long) to capture carry and convexity.</li>
<li>Long-end exposure is a hedge against geopolitical shocks and growth downside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commodities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Energy: Middle East risk skewed to the upside; Russia-Ukraine stalemate entrenched.
<ul>
<li>Maintain a modest long in oil-related exposure as geopolitical insurance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>FX / USD</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Trade-weighted USD remains firm (~118) despite Fed cuts; relative US growth/resilience plus geopolitical demand for USD assets.
<ul>
<li>Favors US-exposed earnings vs EM FX and heavily import-dependent EMs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
