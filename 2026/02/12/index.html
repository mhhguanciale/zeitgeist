<li>Real estate services stocks hit by “AI scare trade”; market increasingly pricing AI disintermediation risk into white-collar service sectors.</li>
<li>Russia-Ukraine war remains hot (civilian casualties from drone strikes); no near-term de-escalation signal from headlines.</li>
<li>Measles outbreaks in South Carolina and Florida (college campuses); localized public-health stress but not macro-scale.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy Backdrop</h2>
<h3>1.1 Growth, Inflation, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nonfarm payrolls essentially flat over 2025 (158.5m in Apr → 158.6m in Jan 2026), unemployment stable around 4.3–4.5%.</li>
<li>Industrial production grinding higher (index ~101.0 in Mar → 102.3 in Dec 2025).</li>
<li>Retail sales plateaued but not rolling over (~$723–735B Mar–Dec 2025).</li>
<li>Prediction markets assign very low odds to negative US GDP in 2025 → consensus is “slow expansion,” not recession.</li>
<li>Yield curve has <strong>re-steepened</strong>: 10Y–2Y spread ~+0.7%, 10Y–3M ~+0.5% → classic post-inversion phase; historically often precedes growth slowdown with a lag, but not yet visible in hard data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI index: 325.7 (Mar) → 331.9 (Dec 2025) – still rising, but pace moderating.</li>
<li>Core PCE: 125.1 (Feb) → 127.4 (Nov 2025) – steady disinflation but not back to pre-COVID trend.</li>
<li>M2 rising modestly (Mar–Dec 2025: 21.6T → 22.4T) – no renewed monetary shock.</li>
<li>Oil (WTI) in low/mid-$60s; energy not a current inflation driver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rates &amp; Financial Conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fed funds down from 4.33% (mid-2025) to 3.64% (Jan 2026) – easing cycle underway but gradual.</li>
<li>2Y ~3.45–3.57%, 10Y ~4.16–4.29% – market pricing modest further cuts, no panic.</li>
<li>Chicago Fed financial conditions index around -0.56 (more negative = easier) – very loose conditions, supportive for risk assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications for portfolio:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Base case remains <strong>soft-landing / slow-growth</strong> with gradual disinflation and modest Fed cuts.</li>
<li>Long-duration nominal Treasuries still have room to perform if upcoming CPI/PCE confirm disinflation; but steepening curve argues against extreme duration concentration.</li>
<li>Equities supported by easy financial conditions; macro risk skew is more about <strong>policy shocks</strong> (trade, immigration, fiscal) than classic cyclical recession in the next 12 months.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. US Policy &amp; Fiscal</h2>
<h3>2.1 Fiscal Path Under Trump</h3>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets heavily skew toward <strong>minimal federal spending cuts in 2025</strong> (well under $50B, far from 5–10% budget cuts).</li>
<li>Revenue markets are oddly structured (absolute dollar ranges that don’t match historical levels); but the signal is:
<ul>
<li>No expectation of a <strong>large positive fiscal surprise</strong> (i.e., big revenue windfall or major consolidation).</li>
<li>Combined with modest/no spending cuts → <strong>persistent large deficits</strong> remain baseline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Market impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasuries / TIPS</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing heavy issuance, especially at the long end, remains a structural headwind for long-duration nominal bonds.</li>
<li>With inflation trending down but not “done,” TIPS remain a reasonable hedge, but near-term inflation prints are more important than fiscal in 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Equities</strong>
<ul>
<li>Lack of aggressive austerity is supportive for cyclicals and risk assets; no near-term “fiscal cliff.”</li>
<li>However, any future debt-ceiling/funding standoff (March–April 2026 window) can create <strong>episodic volatility</strong> and flight-to-quality into shorter-duration Treasuries and USD.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2 Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<ul>
<li>House vote to disapprove Canada tariffs (symbolic) shows bipartisan discomfort with tariffs on allies; suggests:
<ul>
<li>High likelihood that <strong>tariff escalation is targeted</strong> (China, maybe Mexico) rather than broad-based.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction markets see <strong>low odds</strong> that tariffs generate &gt;$250B in 2025 → market not pricing a massive tariff shock.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>US consumer discretionary</strong>: baseline is no large new tariff tax on broad consumer imports; supports margin stability for retailers and consumer brands.</li>
<li><strong>Industrials / exporters</strong>: risk skewed toward <strong>China-related</strong> trade friction rather than NAFTA partners.</li>
<li><strong>FX / EM</strong>: any targeted tariffs on China would support USD vs. CNY and pressure EM exporters; watch for this around the upcoming FX report and US–China dialogues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3 Immigration &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets assign high odds that Trump will deport <strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> (250–500k) but low odds of <strong>&gt;750k</strong> in 2025:
<ul>
<li>Scale is meaningful but not macro-crushing in a 330m population / 160m labor force.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>News flow:
<ul>
<li>Border security incidents (El Paso airspace closure) and DHS controversies.</li>
<li>Protests pressuring large employers (Target) to oppose crackdowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Labor data:
<ul>
<li>Unemployment ~4.3–4.5%, job openings falling (JOLTS from ~7.7m in May to 6.5m in Dec 2025) → labor market cooling but still relatively tight.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Second-order effects:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labor-intensive sectors</strong> (agriculture, construction, hospitality, some manufacturing):
<ul>
<li>Potential localized labor shortages and wage pressure if deportations concentrate in these segments.</li>
<li>Could support <strong>automation / robotics / AI</strong> adoption as a substitute for low-wage labor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regional housing</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Deportations concentrated in specific states could soften rental demand in certain metros, marginally negative for local landlords and consumer spending.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Large consumer brands</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Political pressure campaigns (Target example) increase <strong>reputational and boycott risk</strong>; ESG-sensitive investors may reassess exposure to companies heavily entangled in immigration politics.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Geopolitics &amp; Defense</h2>
<h3>3.1 Russia–Ukraine</h3>
<ul>
<li>Headlines show continued Russian drone strikes on civilians; no sign of imminent de-escalation.</li>
<li>Markets see:
<ul>
<li>Low odds of ceasefire by March 31, 2026.</li>
<li>Roughly balanced odds of ceasefire by end-2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Ongoing demand for munitions, drones, air defense systems; supportive for US and European defense primes and select component suppliers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy &amp; commodities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>With WTI in low-$60s and war “normalized,” risk premium is modest. A ceasefire later in 2026 would be <strong>incrementally bearish</strong> for oil and some ags, but not a collapse driver given current prices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Persistent conflict keeps European fiscal spending on defense elevated and caps appetite for aggressive fiscal consolidation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Middle East &amp; Iran</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trump–Netanyahu meeting: US “prefers deal with Iran to war, for now.”</li>
<li>This signals:
<ul>
<li>Near-term <strong>lower probability of a major Iran–US/Israel kinetic escalation</strong>, which would otherwise spike oil and defense.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, political noise around Netanyahu’s domestic position (roughly coin-flip odds he’s out by end-2026) keeps <strong>Israel risk premium</strong> in defense and regional energy names.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3 China–Taiwan</h3>
<ul>
<li>Markets:
<ul>
<li>Low but non-trivial odds of China invading Taiwan by end-2026.</li>
<li>Higher (but still speculative) odds of invasion “before GTA VI” (longer horizon).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China’s successful test of next-gen lunar capsule and reusable rocket:
<ul>
<li>Confirms <strong>technological and aerospace capability</strong>; indirectly underscores PLA modernization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Portfolio stance:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semiconductors</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Structural risk remains: any Taiwan conflict is catastrophic for global chip supply.</li>
<li>For now, low near-term probability supports ongoing <strong>semis upcycle</strong>, but tail risk argues for:
<ul>
<li>Diversification across US, Korean, and European fabs.</li>
<li>Some exposure to <strong>onshoring beneficiaries</strong> (US fab build-out, equipment makers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defense &amp; cyber</strong>:
<ul>
<li>China–Taiwan tension plus Russia–Ukraine and Middle East risk justify a <strong>strategic overweight</strong> to defense and cyber-security over a multi-year horizon.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Sector Views</h2>
<h3>4.1 Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech / AI</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Apple’s Siri delays highlight <strong>execution risk</strong> vs. AI leaders; relative advantage to companies with faster AI product cycles (cloud, search, enterprise AI).</li>
<li>Microsoft’s zero-day vulnerabilities and ZeroDayRAT headlines:
<ul>
<li>Short-term overhang for large software vendors, but structurally <strong>bullish for cybersecurity</strong> spend (endpoint, identity, mobile security).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI hardware / semis</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Low odds of OpenAI launching consumer hardware by Mar-2026 → AI demand remains <strong>cloud/data-center centric</strong> near term, supportive for GPU and accelerator suppliers and hyperscale capex.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real estate services “AI scare trade”</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Market increasingly pricing <strong>disintermediation risk</strong> in white-collar services (brokers, agents, back-office).</li>
<li>Likely to spread to other fee-based intermediaries (consulting, legal-adjacent, some financial services) over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain overweight to <strong>AI infrastructure</strong> (semis, cloud, networking) vs. consumer hardware.</li>
<li>Tilt toward <strong>cybersecurity</strong> and away from legacy IT vendors with large on-prem exposure.</li>
<li>Be cautious on <strong>human-intensive, low-moat service models</strong> (e.g., real estate brokerage, some BPO) where AI substitution narrative is accelerating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2 Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Public health grant cuts (~$600m) and targeted reductions in HIV prevention and other programs:
<ul>
<li>Negative for <strong>public-health-dependent providers</strong> and NGOs.</li>
<li>Could shift patient load toward emergency rooms and large hospital systems, increasing uncompensated care risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NewYork-Presbyterian nurses’ strike:
<ul>
<li>Reinforces <strong>structural wage pressure</strong> in nursing and hospital labor.</li>
<li>Margin pressure for hospital operators; positive for:
<ul>
<li>Staffing agencies (if not capped by regulation).</li>
<li>Healthcare IT / automation that reduces nurse workload.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Measles outbreaks:
<ul>
<li>Localized, but:
<ul>
<li>Supports vaccine demand and <strong>pro-vaccine product lines</strong>.</li>
<li>AMA’s independent vaccine review effort may change the <strong>political optics</strong> around vaccines; could be modestly supportive for mainstream vaccine makers if it restores trust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prefer <strong>pharma/biotech with strong IP</strong> and vaccine franchises over hospital operators.</li>
<li>Within providers, favor those with:
<ul>
<li>Higher commercial mix.</li>
<li>Demonstrated ability to manage labor costs and invest in automation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.3 Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>WTI in low-$60s with no immediate Iran escalation and a grinding Russia–Ukraine conflict:
<ul>
<li>Base case: <strong>range-bound oil</strong> absent a new geopolitical shock or OPEC+ surprise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction markets see moderate odds of Russia–Ukraine ceasefire by end-2026:
<ul>
<li>Medium-term bearish tilt for oil and some ags, but timing uncertain.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China’s lunar and rocket progress:
<ul>
<li>Signals continued <strong>demand for metals and advanced materials</strong> for aerospace and space programs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Neutral to modestly underweight <strong>broad energy</strong> near term given subdued prices and no acute supply shock.</li>
<li>Maintain some <strong>optionality</strong> via:
<ul>
<li>Select upstream names with low breakevens.</li>
<li>Exposure to <strong>defense-related commodities</strong> (specialty metals) rather than just oil.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.4 Financials &amp; Rates-Sensitive</h3>
<ul>
<li>Yield curve steepening with easy financial conditions:
<ul>
<li>Positive for <strong>banks’ net interest margins</strong> if loan growth holds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low probability of large fiscal consolidation and ongoing deficits:
<ul>
<li>Supports <strong>Treasury supply overhang</strong>, which:
<ul>
<li>Caps upside for long-duration bonds.</li>
<li>Benefits dealers and trading-heavy financials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor <strong>well-capitalized banks</strong> with strong deposit franchises and fee income.</li>
<li>For fixed income, prefer:
<ul>
<li><strong>Intermediate duration</strong> over ultra-long.</li>
<li>Some barbell with short-duration for optionality around Fed path.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.5 Consumer &amp; Retail</h3>
<ul>
<li>McDonald’s strong results driven by value meals:
<ul>
<li>Confirms <strong>value-seeking behavior</strong> in a still-tight but not booming consumer environment.</li>
<li>Retail sales flatlining and low consumer sentiment (~53 in late 2025) support a <strong>trading-down</strong> narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Immigration protests targeting Target:
<ul>
<li>Large retailers face <strong>political and reputational risk</strong> from both sides of immigration debate.</li>
<li>Could see:
<ul>
<li>Localized boycotts.</li>
<li>Higher compliance and security costs in certain states.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Favor <strong>value-oriented QSR and discounters</strong> over premium discretionary.</li>
<li>Within retail, prefer:
<ul>
<li>Strong e-commerce and logistics capabilities.</li>
<li>Lower political exposure (less tied to specific state-level crackdowns).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>5. Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h2>
<ul>
<li>Markets assign roughly balanced odds to <strong>Bitcoin reaching extreme levels</strong> (e.g., $1m) on a long horizon, but this is likely a <strong>moonshot bias</strong> rather than a base case.</li>
<li>Near-term:
<ul>
<li>Macro backdrop (easing Fed, easy financial conditions) is supportive for risk-on, including crypto.</li>
<li>Upcoming ETF/SEC decisions in 2026-H1 remain key structural catalysts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MegaETH:
<ul>
<li>High odds of an airdrop by June 30 and decent odds of a multi-billion FDV at launch.</li>
<li>This is more about <strong>crypto-native rotation and speculative flows</strong> than macro.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Positioning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treat crypto as <strong>high-volatility satellite exposure</strong>, not core macro hedge.</li>
<li>Focus on:
<ul>
<li>Large-cap, high-liquidity assets.</li>
<li>Listed exchanges and payment platforms that benefit from volume spikes, rather than chasing individual token launches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>6. US Political Trajectory (Medium-Term)</h2>
<ul>
<li>2026 midterms:
<ul>
<li>Markets lean toward <strong>Republican Senate, Democratic House</strong> as most likely configuration.</li>
<li>Implies <strong>continued divided government</strong> and policy gridlock on big-ticket items (tax overhaul, healthcare reform).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2028 presidential:
<ul>
<li>Slight edge to Democrats overall, but probabilities are close; no clear long-term policy anchor yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Trump-specific risk:
<ul>
<li>Non-trivial odds of impeachment or early exit by 2026, but still base case is he serves through at least 2026.</li>
<li>This keeps a <strong>volatility premium</strong> on US policy (tariffs, immigration, agency actions) but not enough to change base macro trajectory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment takeaway:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expect <strong>episodic volatility</strong> around:
<ul>
<li>Election-related legislation (like the Save America Act).</li>
<li>Legal/political shocks involving Trump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Structural policy regime likely remains:
<ul>
<li>Pro-defense, skeptical of climate/EV subsidies (especially in blue states).</li>
<li>More hawkish on China trade/tech than on allies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-14 – US January 2026 Retail Sales</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Confirms consumer strength/weakness; impacts discretionary vs. staples tilt and cyclicals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-19 – January 2026 CPI (US)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key for near-term Fed path; stronger disinflation supports duration and growth/tech; upside surprise pressures long bonds and high-multiple names.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-26 – Q4 2025 GDP (2nd Estimate)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Refines growth narrative; weak revision would favor defensives and duration, strong revision supports cyclicals and small caps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-27 – January 2026 PCE &amp; Core PCE</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fed’s preferred gauge; confirmation of disinflation would anchor expectations for further cuts and support risk assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-02-27 – US Core Capital Goods Orders (Durables ex-transport)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read on capex and manufacturing; strong print supports industrials and semis tied to automation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-02 – ISM Manufacturing PMI (February)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Early signal on industrial cycle; expansionary readings favor cyclicals and commodities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-04 – ISM Services PMI (February)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Critical for services-driven inflation view; strong services + sticky prices could slow Fed cuts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-06 – February 2026 Employment Situation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labor tightness vs. cooling; impacts wage/inflation narrative and Fed expectations.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>2026-03-18 – FOMC Meeting &amp; Dot Plot</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Central for rate path; dovish dots support duration and growth; hawkish shift pressures long bonds and high-multiple tech.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expected March 2026 – US FY2027 Budget Proposal</strong></p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Late Feb–March 2026 – US Housing Data Cluster (starts, permits, sales, Case-Shiller)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies housing cycle; weak data favors REITs with strong balance sheets and MBS, strong data supports homebuilders and construction materials.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Expected April 2026 – US Treasury Semiannual FX Report</strong></p>
<ul>
