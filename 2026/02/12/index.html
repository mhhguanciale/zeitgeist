    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h2>Key News Bullets (Market-Relevant)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Middle East: Pentagon preparing a second carrier for the region; Trump signaling preference for a deal with Iran but threatening “very tough” action if demands unmet → higher tail risk premium in oil/defense, but status quo (no full war) still base case.</li>
<li>US politics: Trump pushing a restrictive voter ID / proof-of-citizenship bill; Justice Dept. “lawfare” narrative escalates; immigration enforcement and individual ICE cases getting national press → political space for harder-line immigration and voting rules.</li>
<li>Energy/Coal: White House order for Pentagon to purchase coal-fired power output to “strengthen national defense” → marginal positive for US coal generators and domestic thermal coal producers; negative optics for climate/renewables but likely limited operational impact.</li>
<li>Tech/Security: Microsoft discloses multiple actively exploited Windows/Office zero-days; new mobile spyware (ZeroDayRAT) affecting iOS/Android → supports continued security spend and tailwinds for cybersecurity names.</li>
<li>Real estate: Real-estate services stocks reportedly under pressure on “AI scare trade” narratives → incremental pressure on already-rate-sensitive subsector; could create idiosyncratic opportunity if fears over-extend.</li>
<li>Social media regulation: Landmark trial over “addictive” design of Instagram/YouTube; senior executives testifying → long glide path but raises regulatory/litigation overhang for social/platform names.</li>
<li>Public health: Measles outbreaks in SC and FL (college campus clusters); AMA launching independent vaccine-effectiveness review → modest near-term healthcare demand and potential for renewed vaccine/care narratives, but macro impact small.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>1. Macro &amp; Policy Backdrop</h2>
<h3>1.1 Growth, Inflation, and Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonfarm payrolls have been effectively flat-to-slowly rising: 158.5m (Apr–Dec 2025) to 158.6m (Jan 2026) → economy still adding jobs but at a very modest pace.</li>
<li>Unemployment has been rangebound around 4.1–4.5%, at 4.3% in Jan 2026 → “softish” labor market but far from recessionary.</li>
<li>Industrial production up from ~101.0 (Mar 2025) to 102.3 (Dec 2025) → slow but positive real-economy momentum.</li>
<li>Headline retail sales effectively plateaued mid-2025 (roughly 722–735bn range) → consumption stable rather than booming.</li>
</ul>
<p>→ Near-term negative GDP growth in 2025/early 2026 looks unlikely; equity risk remains more about valuations and policy than imminent recession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inflation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI climbed from 325.7 (Mar 2025) to 331.9 (Dec 2025); Core PCE rose from 125.1 (Feb) to 127.4 (Nov) → disinflation is happening but slowly.</li>
<li>The Fed funds rate has been gradually cut from 4.33% (spring 2025) to 3.64% (Jan 2026) → Fed easing cycle is underway but still restrictive in real terms.</li>
<li>Financial conditions index is deeply negative (~-0.56 early Feb 2026), meaning very easy financial conditions despite higher nominal rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>→ Combination of ongoing disinflation, easy financial conditions, and modest growth is supportive for risk assets and duration, with the main risk being a re-acceleration in inflation from energy/geopolitics or fiscal surprises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rates &amp; Curve:</p>
<ul>
<li>2Y yield ~3.45–3.57%; 10Y ~4.16–4.29% → modest upward slope.</li>
<li>10Y–2Y spread ~0.7%; 10Y–3M spread ~0.5% → curve has re-steepened into positive territory; classic inversion signal has faded.</li>
<li>M2 money supply is grinding higher from ~21.6T (Mar) to 22.4T (Dec 2025) → monetary backdrop moving from mildly restrictive toward neutral.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Duration: current curve shape and gradual easing favors moderate extension into intermediate/long Treasuries, especially if upcoming CPI prints stay benign.</li>
<li>Equities: macro environment still constructive; risk is more from policy shock (tariffs, immigration, fiscal cliff) than organic cycle turn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 Fiscal Policy, Deficit, and Treasuries</h3>
<p>Prediction-market signals (interpreted qualitatively):</p>
<ul>
<li>Large, near-term fiscal contraction (≥5–10% budget cuts in 2025) is viewed as very unlikely.</li>
<li>Deep revenue shortfalls or vast tariff receipts as a meaningful replacement for revenue are also seen as unlikely.</li>
<li>Baseline: fiscal stance remains loose to mildly contractionary in 2025–26; any consolidation is gradual.</li>
</ul>
<p>Investment takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treasuries:
<ul>
<li>Low probability of sharp, front-loaded austerity reduces risk of a sudden growth air-pocket but keeps medium-term term-premium pressure (deficit concerns) intact.</li>
<li>With the curve modestly steepening and Fed easing, intermediate maturities look best risk/reward; ultra-long duration remains more sensitive to political/debt-ceiling headlines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equities:
<ul>
<li>Loose fiscal + easier financial conditions = constructive for cyclicals and growth.</li>
<li>Over the next 12–18 months, focus on sectors that can benefit from continued nominal growth but are less exposed to potential late-cycle cost of capital back-up (e.g., quality tech, healthcare, staples vs. highly levered small caps).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2. Geopolitics &amp; Policy Risk</h2>
<h3>2.1 US Domestic Politics: Trump Admin, Impeachment/Resignation Noise</h3>
<p>Markets currently assigning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low odds to Trump being impeached or resigning by end-2026.</li>
<li>Moderately elevated chatter about Trump leaving office before certain pop-culture milestones, but still close to 50/50 → in practice, markets treat Trump as likely to serve through at least the next couple of years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>US policy path is likely to stay on a Trump-first, more unilateralist trajectory:
<ul>
<li>Harder line on immigration.</li>
<li>Tougher stance on Iran and Cuba; willingness to use sanctions and military signaling (e.g., carriers).</li>
<li>Pro-fossil-fuel tilt (e.g., coal order for DoD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For equities:
<ul>
<li>Defense and energy benefit from higher geopolitical tension + more muscular posture, but with Iran, the administration currently signaling preference for a deal over outright war, limiting immediate spike risk.</li>
<li>Domestic regulated utilities and renewables face a less supportive federal climate policy, but state-level incentives and corporate decarbonization targets cushion the downside.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2 Immigration &amp; Labor</h3>
<p>Signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets heavily favor substantial deportations under Trump (hundreds of thousands scale) as plausible.</li>
<li>Current news: immigration crackdown in Minnesota triggering consumer protests; high-profile ICE detention (Irishman) drawing international attention.</li>
<li>Political incentives: immigration is central to Trump’s coalition; strong support for hard measures is visible in House bills (e.g., SAVE Act focus on citizenship proof).</li>
</ul>
<p>Second-order macro/sector impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor market:
<ul>
<li>Large-scale deportations would predominantly hit lower-wage, labor-intensive sectors: agriculture, construction, hospitality, certain logistics/warehousing.</li>
<li>With unemployment ~4.3% and job openings trending down (JOLTS from ~7.7m in May to 6.5m in Dec 2025), the labor market is cooling but still tight; mass removals could re-tighten some local labor pools and push wage inflation up at the low end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Housing:
<ul>
<li>Reduced immigrant household formation could be marginally negative for rental demand in certain metros (multi-family, SFR landlords).</li>
<li>Construction labor shortages, however, would support higher replacement costs and thus floor home prices, even while housing starts have softened (from 1.49m Feb 2025 to 1.25m Oct 2025).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumption:
<ul>
<li>Deportations remove consumers and taxpayers; localized demand drag especially in Sunbelt and ag/food service-heavy regions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning angles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Underweight:
<ul>
<li>Pure-play labor-intensive services with thin margins and high immigrant exposure (certain casual dining, some regional contractors, low-end agriculture processors).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>More constructive:
<ul>
<li>Capital-intensive businesses that can substitute labor with automation (industrials automation, logistics tech).</li>
<li>Select homebuilders with exposure to markets seeing structural undersupply; labor constraints may support pricing power even if unit volumes moderate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.3 Trade &amp; Tariffs</h3>
<p>Signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very low market-implied odds that tariffs will drive &gt;$250B of federal revenue in 2025.</li>
<li>Ongoing expectation of “some” tariff activity but not on a scale that fundamentally replaces other revenue sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base case: targeted and politically visible tariffs (China, EVs/batteries, strategic sectors) rather than broad-based hikes.</li>
<li>Inflation:
<ul>
<li>With core CPI and PCE still drifting up, any new tariffs are more likely to complicate disinflation than drive a new inflation spike; but they can create idiosyncratic cost pressure in autos, electronics, and industrial machinery.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sector positioning:
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Domestic producers in targeted sectors (US steel, some autos with less China input exposure).</li>
<li>North America-focused supply chains and nearshoring beneficiaries (Mexico-related manufacturers, US rail/trucking).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid:
<ul>
<li>Firms with critical dependence on Chinese inputs and limited pricing power (commodity hardware OEMs, low-margin apparel/retailers).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.4 Energy, Russia/Ukraine, Iran, and Middle East</h3>
<p>Russia/Ukraine:</p>
<ul>
<li>Markets lean toward a ceasefire <em>eventually</em> by end-2026 but see low odds by Mar 31, 2026.</li>
<li>Near-term headlines: ongoing Russian drone strikes with civilian casualties → conflict staying hot in the short run.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iran/Middle East:</p>
<ul>
<li>Second US carrier preparation, but Trump signaling desire for a deal with Iran “for now.”</li>
<li>US oil sanctions on Cuba contributing to severe fuel shortages, flight cancellations, and tourism crunch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy-market implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil:
<ul>
<li>WTI is stable in low-60s (~62–65) despite geopolitical noise; implies markets view these risks as contained.</li>
<li>Ceasefire in Ukraine by 2026 would be modestly bearish for oil and European gas over a multi-year horizon (more normalized Russian flows), but sanctions/structural shifts will cap that effect.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Equities:
<ul>
<li>Near term, defense and certain energy names benefit from the elevated but controlled tension.</li>
<li>Cuba shock underlines US willingness to deploy energy sanctions; this keeps geopolitical risk premium structurally higher for certain producers and tanker/shipping names, but base-price impact is contained for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy:
<ul>
<li>Neutral to modest overweight upstream with strong balance sheets; use geopolitical spikes to trim rather than chase.</li>
<li>Avoid over-levered, high-cost producers that need sustained price &gt;70 to thrive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Defense:
<ul>
<li>Maintain exposure: ongoing Ukraine aid, heightened Middle East tension, and Pacific deterrence vs. China support top-line, irrespective of ceasefire timing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.5 China, Taiwan, and Leadership Risk</h3>
<p>Signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-but-non-trivial probability assigned to a China invasion of Taiwan by end-2026; higher speculative chatter when framed against unrelated media milestones, but still minority view.</li>
<li>Very low odds assigned to Xi departing before 2027.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Base case: continued gray-zone pressure around Taiwan (ADIZ incursions, economic coercion) without full-scale invasion.</li>
<li>Semiconductors:
<ul>
<li>Systemic risk remains: any escalation around Taiwan is catastrophic for global chip supply and thus for global equities.</li>
<li>Even without conflict, West continues to diversify supply (US/EU fabs, Japanese/Indian initiatives), good for capex-driven semicap and selected foundries outside Taiwan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CNY and Chinese equities:
<ul>
<li>Stable leadership plus structural slowdown and property issues likely mean weak domestic equity performance vs. US.</li>
<li>China’s upcoming NPC in March 2026 is the main venue for stimulus or structural-reform hints; markets currently expect incremental, not “big bazooka,” measures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semis:
<ul>
<li>Maintain core exposure to diversified global leaders whose production isn’t exclusively Taiwan-centric.</li>
<li>Size China/Taiwan tail risk via hedges (index puts, defense exposure, possibly a small allocation to energy/commodities as conflict hedge).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>China exposure:
<ul>
<li>Treat China as a tactical rather than strategic overweight; prefer indirect plays (EM ex-China, multinationals selling into China) over onshore A-shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Sectors</h2>
<h3>3.1 Technology, AI, and Cybersecurity</h3>
<p>Key signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very low expectation that OpenAI will have a new consumer hardware product by Mar 31, 2026 → AI commercialization remains primarily software/cloud-based for now rather than hardware-driven.</li>
<li>Ongoing reports of zero-day exploits in Microsoft ecosystems and new mobile spyware.</li>
<li>Real-estate services under “AI scare trade” pressure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semis &amp; AI:
<ul>
<li>AI demand remains cloud/data-center-centric rather than hinging on a single new hardware form factor.</li>
<li>Still supports high compute (GPUs, accelerators), memory/high-bandwidth DRAM, and networking vendors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cybersecurity:
<ul>
<li>Repeated zero-day headlines reinforce secular growth in security budgets across enterprises and government.</li>
<li>Good backdrop for pure-play security vendors; large platforms (MSFT, GOOG) still central but face both risk (reputation) and opportunity (upsell security suites).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Software/Services vs Real Assets:
<ul>
<li>Market narrative of AI displacing white-collar intermediaries shows up in real-estate services stock pressure.</li>
<li>Overreaction in some cases: AI may compress fees but increase transaction throughput and data-driven services; look for high-quality platforms that can integrate AI.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overweight:
<ul>
<li>AI infrastructure and cybersecurity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Selective:
<ul>
<li>Tech platforms facing regulatory/trial risk (social media), but with long growth runways; assign a higher litigation discount rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Underweight/Opportunistic:
<ul>
<li>Real-estate services only where valuations fully reflect both cyclical (volumes tied to housing) and structural (AI disintermediation) headwinds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Energy &amp; Coal</h3>
<p>Key signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trump directing DoD to purchase power from coal plants to “strengthen national defense.”</li>
<li>Oil ~mid-60s with no acute price spike despite carriers moving toward Middle East.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coal:
<ul>
<li>Marginal lifeline to select coal-heavy utilities and miners (contracted baseload for military installations, higher plant utilization).</li>
<li>Not a sectoral game-changer: plant retirements and state-level decarbonization still dominate long run.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Oil &amp; Gas:
<ul>
<li>Price behavior suggests markets discount a near-term Iran war but price a persistent geopolitical premium.</li>
<li>Cuba sanctions show US willingness to use energy equities as leverage → risk for companies with heavy exposure to sanctioned regimes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold:
<ul>
<li>Quality integrated and low-cost E&amp;Ps, with the expectation of range-bound oil and periodic geopolitical spikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tactical niche:
<ul>
<li>Coal names with clear line-of-sight to DoD contracts and long-term offtake; treat as a yield/turnaround trade, not a secular growth story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3 Financials and Rates-Sensitive Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Banking:
<ul>
<li>Steepening yield curve (10Y–2Y ~0.7%) is supportive for NIMs.</li>
<li>Easy financial conditions and modest loan demand growth favor regional and credit-sensitive banks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real estate / REITs:
<ul>
<li>Case-Shiller index has flattened but not rolled over meaningfully (sideways-to-slightly-up through late 2025).</li>
<li>Housing starts have softened; supply constraints and labor costs limit downside to home prices.</li>
<li>REITs remain sensitive to long rates; with 10Y stable around mid-4s and Fed easing, total-return profile improves if inflation stays contained.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>High-quality banks, mortgage servicers, and select REITs tied to structurally growing niches (data centers, logistics).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Avoid:
<ul>
<li>Over-levered RE entities and fee-driven real-estate services under both cyclical and AI structural pressure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.4 Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measles outbreaks and an AMA-led independent vaccine-effectiveness review process:
<ul>
<li>Modest positive for vaccine makers and diagnostics as public attention refocuses on coverage and booster strategies.</li>
<li>Could raise litigation/regulatory complexity for certain products but over multiyear horizons.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue core allocation to:
<ul>
<li>Large-cap diversified pharma/biotech with vaccine and infectious-disease franchises.</li>
<li>Managed care and providers less sensitive to single-disease spikes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.5 Consumer &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Consumers:
<ul>
<li>Retail sales plateauing and sentiment stuck in low 50s → consumers are cautious but not collapsing.</li>
<li>Labor market still stable; immigration crackdowns risk localized consumption dips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Housing:
<ul>
<li>Starts cooling; price index flat-to-slightly up, implying affordability constraints offset by supply undershoot.</li>
<li>Any tightening of immigration could reduce marginal demand but also constrain construction labor, supporting price stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Positioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Underweight:
<ul>
<li>Low-end discretionary retailers with high exposure to immigrant-heavy communities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Favor:
<ul>
<li>Quality homebuilders with strong land banks in supply-constrained markets and the ability to manage labor shortages.</li>
<li>Landlords in metros with structural undersupply, not solely immigration-driven demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.6 Crypto &amp; Speculation</h3>
<p>Signals:</p>
<ul>
<li>High speculative chatter around extreme BTC outcomes (e.g., $1m scenarios) and niche altcoin launches/airdrops; but many individual “moonshot” outcomes are still priced as unlikely.</li>
<li>Macro backdrop: Fed easing, easy financial conditions, stable USD index (~118) are moderately supportive of risk-on and speculative assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crypto:
<ul>
<li>Structural bid for BTC/ETH remains underpinned by “digital gold” and AI/blockchain narratives.</li>
<li>Short-term path highly sensitive to macro (real yields, regulatory news), not just idiosyncratic launches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For you:
<ul>
<li>Treat crypto allocation as high-volatility, macro-levered satellite exposure; tie sizing to broader risk-on/risk-off stance rather than micro-events like individual airdrops.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>4. Individual Names / Themes from News</h2>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft:
<ul>
<li>Zero-day exploit news is negative optics but highlights centrality of MSFT in enterprise IT and security.</li>
<li>Security upsell + AI cloud demand remain core drivers; watch for any regulatory scrutiny around software liability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meta/Alphabet (indirectly via Instagram/YouTube trial):
<ul>
<li>Litigation over “addictive” design raises long-run legal/regulatory risk but will be slow-moving.</li>
<li>In the near term, ad demand is more sensitive to macro than to this trial; treat legal risk as part of the discount rate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real-estate Platforms:
<ul>
<li>“AI scare trade” can overshoot fundamentals; if you see quality franchises punished indiscriminately, there may be a mean-reversion trade once AI narratives normalize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>13 Feb 2026 – US January 2026 CPI</strong>
