    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Feb-2026)</h1>

<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Pentagon deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East; Trump administration signaling potential strikes if Iran talks fail.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/Cyber:</strong> Microsoft confirms active exploitation of critical zero-day bugs in Windows/Office. Apple's Siri AI revamp reportedly facing further delays.</li>
<li><strong>Policy:</strong> Trump administration cutting $600M in public health funding from four Democratic-led states; House passes &quot;Save America Act&quot; voting rules.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Investment Guidelines &amp; Thesis</h3>
<h4>1. Macro: The &quot;Harder&quot; Soft Landing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> The narrative is shifting from &quot;resilient labor&quot; to &quot;stalled growth.&quot; FRED data shows Job Openings (JOLTS) collapsing to ~6.5M and Unemployment ticking up to the 4.3-4.4% range. Combined with news of overstated payrolls, the consumer is weaker than headline GDP suggests.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long Duration:</strong> With the Fed Funds Rate projected to cut further (currently ~3.64% trajectory), and the economy cooling, long-end Treasuries offer capital appreciation potential.</li>
<li><strong>Steepener Trade:</strong> The 10Y-2Y spread has widened to ~0.71. Continue positioning for a steeper curve as the front end drops faster than the long end.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Consumer Discretionary:</strong> Flat retail sales and weak hiring data suggest downside risk for retailers (watch Walmart earnings closely).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Geopolitics: Energy Asymmetry</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> WTI Crude is trading softly (~$64), pricing in demand destruction but ignoring supply risks. The deployment of a second carrier to the Middle East and Trump's rhetoric regarding Iran creates a mispriced risk premium.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long Energy Volatility/Calls:</strong> Oil is currently priced for peace/recession. A kinetic event involving Iran would spike prices immediately. Low spot prices make hedging cheap.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Primes:</strong> Continued conflict in Ukraine (ceasefire unlikely by March 2026 per prediction markets) and Middle East posturing supports sustained defense backlogs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>3. Tech: Infrastructure over Hardware</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> The &quot;AI Consumer&quot; cycle is hitting execution walls (Apple delays, OpenAI hardware unlikely by Q1). However, the &quot;AI Infrastructure&quot; and &quot;Security&quot; cycle remains robust.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Microsoft's zero-day news underscores that security spend is non-discretionary for enterprise.</li>
<li><strong>Semis/Datacenter:</strong> Focus remains on the &quot;picks and shovels&quot; (Nvidia earnings next week) rather than consumer edge devices which are seeing delayed software rollouts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Policy: Fiscal Tightening &amp; Labor Supply</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Prediction markets assign ~85% probability to mass deportations (250k-500k). Simultaneously, targeted fiscal cuts (e.g., health funding) are beginning.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Short/Avoid Hospitals:</strong> The combination of funding cuts to specific states and potential labor unrest (nurses strikes) creates margin compression risk.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Intensive Services:</strong> Watch for wage inflation shocks in agriculture and hospitality if deportation policies reduce the immigrant labor supply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>5. Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> High probability of a MegaETH airdrop by June (~77%) suggests liquidity events are returning to the ecosystem.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain exposure to major tokens; market structure favors established L1s/L2s over speculative hardware plays.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
