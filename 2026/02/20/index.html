    <h1>Daily Memo (20-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Tensions escalate as Trump issues a 10-day ultimatum to Iran regarding a nuclear deal; markets are pricing in a high likelihood of military strikes if terms aren't met.</li>
<li><strong>Russia:</strong> Administration signaling a potential diplomatic thaw (&quot;bringing Russia in from the cold&quot;), potentially reshaping energy sanctions and trade dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Markets:</strong> Asian equities and US futures slipped while oil rallied on Middle East war risk; &quot;AI scare trade&quot; volatility persists ahead of major earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Tech:</strong> Mark Zuckerberg revealed discussions with Tim Cook regarding teen safety; Samsung rebooting Bixby with AI integration.</li>
<li><strong>Korea:</strong> Former President Yoon sentenced to life for martial law attempt; political instability remains high.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Warsh&quot; Fed &amp; Sticky Inflation</h3>
<p>The consensus for Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair has solidified to near-certainty. Markets are adjusting to a potentially less dovish regime than previously anticipated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Outlook:</strong> Expect a &quot;Pause-Pause-Pause&quot; cadence for the immediate future. The market is pricing out aggressive cuts in Q1/Q2 2026 as inflation data remains sticky (FRED CPI trend shows a steady climb to ~332.8).</li>
<li><strong>Yields:</strong> The 10Y Treasury yield has crept up to ~4.09% (FRED). With the DHS shutdown likely to last 10+ days, fiscal drag is a concern, but the inflation floor is keeping yields elevated. Avoid excessive duration exposure ($ZROZ) until the 10Y tests 4.4% resistance.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment holding steady at 4.3% suggests the economy is not cooling fast enough to force the Fed's hand immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics: The &quot;War Premium&quot; Returns</h3>
<p>The risk of a kinetic event in the Middle East has spiked significantly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran Strike Risk:</strong> There is a growing probability of a US or Israeli strike on Iranian infrastructure within the next 4-6 weeks. This is no longer a tail risk but a base case scenario being priced into derivatives.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Play:</strong> Long Oil ($USO, $XLE) is the primary hedge. If a strike occurs, expect a sharp spike in WTI.</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Continued accumulation of Defense ($XAR) is warranted. Beyond the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues with Russia capturing territory (Rodynske), ensuring sustained demand for munitions and hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA):</strong> Earnings are imminent. Expectations are for a beat, but the bar is high. The &quot;AI scare trade&quot; mentioned in headlines suggests skittishness; a miss or weak guidance could trigger a broader correction in the Nasdaq 100.</li>
<li><strong>Google ($GOOGL):</strong> Gemini is performing exceptionally well on internal benchmarks (FrontierMath), potentially narrowing the perception gap with OpenAI. This is a bullish signal for Google's AI capex efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Space Economy:</strong> The SpaceX IPO is the &quot;white whale&quot; for late 2026, with valuations likely exceeding $1T. Look for sympathy plays in publicly traded aerospace suppliers and legacy defense primes that may partner or compete.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiscal &amp; Political</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown:</strong> A DHS shutdown is highly probable and expected to last over two weeks. This creates short-term volatility for government contractors but is usually a &quot;buy the dip&quot; event for the broader market.</li>
<li><strong>2026 Midterms:</strong> Early indicators suggest a strong Democratic performance, potentially flipping the House. Gridlock remains the long-term base case.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Consolidating in the $60k-$62k range. The market is waiting for a catalyst, possibly a specific mention from Trump or a shift in ETF flows. Volatility is compressing, suggesting a breakout (up or down) is near.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Acting as the primary geopolitical hedge alongside oil. With the 10Y yield rising, Gold's resilience indicates strong safe-haven demand independent of real rates.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 20 (Today):</strong> <strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA) Earnings Report.</strong> <em>High impact on AI sentiment and broad indices ($QQQ).</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 26:</strong> <strong>PCE Inflation Data.</strong> <em>Critical for confirming the &quot;sticky inflation&quot; thesis and Fed pause trajectory.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> <strong>US/Iran Ultimatum Window.</strong> <em>Trump's 10-day warning expires; high risk of military escalation.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 06:</strong> <strong>February Jobs Report.</strong> <em>Key metric to see if labor market cracks are widening.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> <strong>CPI Inflation Report.</strong> <em>Will confirm if the recent uptick in prices is a trend or noise.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> <strong>FOMC Meeting.</strong> <em>Expectation is a hold; focus will be on the dot plot and Warsh transition signaling.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mid-April:</strong> <strong>Q1 Bank Earnings.</strong> <em>Health check on the consumer and commercial real estate exposure.</em></li>
</ul>
