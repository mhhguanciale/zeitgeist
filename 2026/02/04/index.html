</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China Auto Regulations</strong>
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Large Cap Tech Earnings (Ongoing)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Major tech earnings season is underway, with explicit attention on margin, cost controls, global demand signals, and product mentions (AI, cloud, supply chain). Advertising and e-commerce sentiment are pivotal for forward guides.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro/Markets</h2>
<h3>Growth, Inflation, and Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US GDP Tracking &amp; Recession Risk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Macro consensus: growth trending above 2.5% for 2026 but with a downward bias. Prediction market odds for negative US GDP growth in 2026 remain low, but upside “boom” (&gt;5%) is priced out.</li>
<li>FRED: Latest trend for nonfarm payrolls is flat-to-modestly higher; unemployment moving up to 4.4–4.5% by end-2025 (lagged data).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initial and continuing jobless claims remain at ~1.8–1.9M, showing no major stress, with JOLTS (job openings) gradually falling but still above pre-pandemic levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Fed</strong>
<ul>
<li>Markets expect at least two Fed rate cuts this year, with chances for more aggressive cuts only if data deteriorate sharply.</li>
<li>Market-implied inflation for 2026 is modest (2.5–3.5%), with low conviction on a meaningful overshoot. FRED Core CPI and Core PCE show continued monthly increases, but no red flags for re-acceleration.</li>
<li>10Y Treasuries sitting in the 4.24–4.29% range. Yield curve has slightly un-inverted but is still relatively flat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal/Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown (Averted for Now)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Near-term risk of a prolonged shutdown is off; focus now shifts to late-Feb/Mar government funding deadlines and potential for future bond market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Credit Rating Watch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Elevated risk for another US credit downgrade this year; debates on fiscal sustainability ongoing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Election/Geopolitical Volatility</strong>
<ul>
<li>Split government and high political churn (impeachment chatter, regulatory threats, ongoing primary races) can drive late-cycle volatility, particularly in risk asset P/E multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Global – Macro Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>China</strong>
<ul>
<li>Near-zero risk of leadership change in 2026; no abrupt currency or equity movements expected from politics alone.</li>
<li>China’s Q1 GDP tracking is modest, mild policy easing expected (PBoC cut bias), weak inflation. Major import: China is banning certain EV features, continuing to diverge from global auto standards, which impacts multinationals’ cost structures/export strategies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>
<ul>
<li>ECB, UK, and Eurozone policy on hold for coming meetings. No near-term hikes, cuts possible from H2.</li>
<li>Eurozone GDP consensus for 2026 points to slow growth, not deep contraction; watch for select EU country downgrades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>
<ul>
<li>BOJ on hold, JPY stable. Snap election in Japan likely to re-confirm LDP majority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Themes</h2>
<h3>Equities (US)</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>S&amp;P 500/Nasdaq: Trading Range</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction market distribution heavily favors a tight trading range for S&amp;P 500 (6600–7400) and NDX (24,400–27,000) in the near term, high realized volatility unlikely absent a shock.</li>
<li>Second-order: Tight tape may persist due to offsetting macro (slowing top-line) and micro (cost controls, tech AI premium) forces.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tech &amp; AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI model “arms race” still supportive for semiconductors (esp. Nvidia), cloud, and platform players (GOOGL, MSFT, META, AMZN).</li>
<li>Tech IPO market is thawing: Discord, Anthropic, OpenAI, SpaceX likely to announce or execute IPOs by end-2026; focus on IPO window and associated index flow.</li>
<li>Regulatory risk (AI content/copyright, antitrust) is present but not yet a near-term catalyst.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Modest chance of major legislative action on pharma monopolies this year; obesity/Alzheimer’s drugs regulatory momentum continues but with payer pushback.</li>
<li>Vaccine policies remain politically sensitive but not a market-mover unless vaccine sentiment turns further in election battlegrounds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer/Discretionary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large retailers and platforms are likely to reference “affordability” and tariff risk in upcoming earnings.</li>
<li>Housing affordability continues to worsen: Case-Shiller index remains high; prediction markets see no imminent home price collapse, but mortgage rates are volatile and move above/below 6–6.5% is in play this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financials/Banks</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets price limited risk for another major US bank failure by Q2, but ongoing consolidation in regional banks and asset managers is likely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy/Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Low conviction for runaway oil (&gt; $70) or WTI collapse (&lt; $50) in early 2026; OPEC+ and US government policy are the swing variables.</li>
<li>Uranium/uranium miners see persistent supply-driven upside risk for the next few quarters.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crypto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Spot bitcoin and ether ETF flows are mixed; volatility and swing moves dominate short-term outlook, but long-run flows are sticky.</li>
<li>Multiple altcoins, stablecoin products, and exchanges set for new token launches; watch for spillover into regulated equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold/Silver</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold sentiment is strongly constructive for coming months (multiple market contracts favor settlements &gt;$5,000 in June), broadly consistent with expected higher volatility from US fiscal/credit uncertainty and persistent geopolitical tail risk.</li>
<li>Silver also expected higher, though volatility is acute.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics &amp; Major Event Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle East – Iran/Israel/US</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Escalation risk: Markets assign meaningful odds (&gt;30%) that US or Israel will conduct strikes on Iran before June; any actual strike (even limited) will sharply impact oil, defense, and gold for days to weeks.</li>
<li>Near-term focus is on US-Iran talks (in Oman); any sudden cancellation or military move would impact risk assets overnight.</li>
<li>Israel-Gaza/Lebanon: Ceasefire fragility; low-to-moderate probability of major new ground/air offensive. Disarmament of regional militias is a persistent market “tail” but not imminent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Russia-Ukraine</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Little confidence in an imminent comprehensive ceasefire, though smaller swaps/deals are probable.</li>
<li>Ukraine facing personnel/leadership stress by H2; ongoing risk of limited Russian offensives impacting energy/commodity supply routes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US-China</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Geopolitical flashpoint risk is elevated but not imminent for Taiwan (“hot” invasion odds by EoY remain very low). Any movement on Section 301 tariffs or disruptions to semis supply chain are still the main channels for shock risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company &amp; Name-Specific Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mega-Cap Tech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing earnings will continue to differentiate for AI/cloud exposure, margin. Expect focus on incremental AI/AI-chip capex, cost efficiency, and regulation in earnings calls.</li>
<li>Specific: Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google regularly mention AI and regulation, with AI-driven monetization cited as a priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EVs/Autos:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla: Next few quarters will be scrutinized for delivery shortfalls (prediction consensus is &lt;350,000 for Q1), capacity expansion pace, and regulatory risk (especially in China, due to the new safety code). Model line/cost innovation remains uncertain.</li>
<li>Trad autos: No imminent upside catalyst absent tech-driven cost wins; regulatory pressure mounting in both China and EU.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple defense IPOs/secondaries expected (Anduril, SpaceX, others). Bipartisan support for large defense budgets, but potential supply-driven shocks if Middle East escalates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare/Biotech:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing FDA decisions for obesity, Alzheimer’s, and gene editing therapies. Large cap (LLY) and leading biotechs flagged as M&amp;A/partnering candidates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crypto, Fintech, Exchanges:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>New listing/IPO windows open for Kraken, Coinbase-adjacent names, further normalizing crypto and potentially increasing regulatory scrutiny.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order Risk &amp; Watchlist</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit/Defaults</strong>
<ul>
<li>Market expects no systemic US bank/brokerage failures in the next quarter; some tail risk for a weaker regional player.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Regulation/Taxes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Low probability of disruptive tax moves before the 2026 midterms, but split government increases longer-term uncertainty.</li>
<li>Real estate: Institutional buying/taxation faces moderate legislative risk this year, especially in “blue” states (California, NY).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Natural Disaster / Insurance</strong>
<ul>
<li>Elevated odds (&gt;50%) of a major (&gt;7.0) earthquake this year, especially in the Pacific Rim (CA/Japan). Real estate and insurance exposures (esp. West Coast) should be reviewed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic/Public Health</strong>
<ul>
<li>No new global pandemic priced imminently; some uptick in vaccine-preventable diseases (measles, flu) but not enough for systemic demand hit in travel, leisure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
