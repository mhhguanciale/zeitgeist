    <h1>Daily Memo (23-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Tensions escalating significantly; Trump administration considering targeted strikes on Iran following security incidents. Israel intensifying operations against Hezbollah.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> DHS shutdown active with emergency measures implemented; TSA PreCheck/Global Entry suspended, impacting travel efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Trade:</strong> Supreme Court ruled against previous Trump tariff structures, yet administration signaling new 10% blanket tariffs and 100% tariffs on Canada.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> <strong>Novo Nordisk (NVO)</strong> obesity drug failed trial against <strong>Eli Lilly (LLY)</strong> rival; NVO shares down significantly. <strong>Blue Owl</strong> liquidity curbs sparking contagion fears in private credit.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Warsh &amp; War&quot; Hedge</h3>
<p>The market is currently pricing in two distinct, high-impact regimes simultaneously: a dovish monetary pivot and a kinetic geopolitical escalation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Chair Pivot:</strong> Markets are assigning near-certainty (&gt;90%) to Kevin Warsh replacing Powell. This signals a shift toward a more politically aligned, potentially looser monetary policy. Expect yield curve steepening as the front end drops on anticipated cuts (March/April) while the long end stays sticky due to inflation/tariff concerns.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk Premium:</strong> Despite WTI Crude languishing in the low $60s, prediction markets indicate a &gt;50% chance of US/Israel strikes on Iran by early March. Energy markets are mispricing the risk of a Strait of Hormuz disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Trade War Confusion:</strong> The Supreme Court ruling creates short-term volatility, but the high probability of new executive tariff actions suggests importers and cross-border logistics (especially Canada-US rail/trucking) face continued headwinds.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector &amp; Asset Class Outlook</h3>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace ($XAR, $ITA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullish:</strong> Kinetic risks are at local highs. High probability of US/Israel strikes on Iran within the next 2-4 weeks and continued Russian territorial gains in Ukraine (Pokrovsk/Lyman) necessitate increased defense spending.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> IPO valuation expectations are anchoring &gt;$1T. This creates a halo effect for the broader aerospace sector and legacy suppliers (Boeing, Lockheed) despite specific program failures (Starliner).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy ($XLE, $USO)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Upside:</strong> Oil is currently trading on weak demand signals (China GDP concerns), ignoring the supply shock risk from an Iran conflict. With the DHS shutdown impacting domestic operations and potential sanctions enforcement tightening, long positions in O&amp;G majors and defense-adjacent energy firms serve as a cheap portfolio hedge.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI ($QQQ, $SMH)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Hardware/Software:</strong> <strong>Google (GOOGL)</strong> Gemini is showing strength in benchmarks, challenging <strong>OpenAI's</strong> dominance. <strong>Apple (AAPL)</strong> event on March 4th (rumored M5 chip/iPhone 17e) serves as a near-term catalyst for the hardware cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> South Korean markets (KOSPI) hitting record highs suggests robust demand for memory/logic chips, boding well for <strong>Micron (MU)</strong> and <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> ahead of earnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare ($XLV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GLP-1 Divergence:</strong> <strong>Eli Lilly (LLY)</strong> is the clear beneficiary of Novo Nordisk's trial failure. Expect capital rotation into LLY to accelerate.</li>
<li><strong>Vaccines:</strong> Growing measles outbreaks in the US (Georgia) and rising case count probabilities suggest a tactical bid for vaccine manufacturers (e.g., <strong>GSK</strong>, <strong>MRK</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto &amp; Fintech</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Price action remains choppy ($58k-$64k range). While long-term sovereign adoption theses (e.g., El Salvador, potential US reserve) remain active, short-term ETF flows are mixed.</li>
<li><strong>Private Credit Risk:</strong> <strong>Blue Owl</strong> news is a red flag for the shadow banking sector. Monitor BDCs and alternative asset managers for liquidity stress signs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Watch List / Trade Ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Long:</strong> <strong>Eli Lilly (LLY)</strong> on competitive moat expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Long:</strong> <strong>Lockheed Martin (LMT)</strong> / <strong>RTX Corp (RTX)</strong> on immediate conflict escalation risks.</li>
<li><strong>Hedge:</strong> <strong>WTI Crude Calls</strong> or <strong>Energy ETFs</strong>; current prices do not reflect the &gt;50% implied odds of an Iran strike in the next 14 days.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid/Short:</strong> <strong>Novo Nordisk (NVO)</strong> on pipeline failure. <strong>Airlines ($JETS)</strong> facing dual headwinds of DHS shutdown (travel friction) and potential oil spikes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 27:</strong> January Core PCE Price Index (Inflation gauge).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> Implied deadline for potential US/Israel kinetic action against Iran (based on prediction flows).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 4:</strong> Apple NYC Event (Product launches).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 6:</strong> February US Jobs Report (Payroll/Unemployment).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> February US CPI Release.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> FOMC Meeting (High probability of rate cut).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 31:</strong> Potential expiration of US Government Continuing Resolution (Shutdown risk).</li>
</ul>
