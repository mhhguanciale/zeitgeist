    <h1>Daily Memo (16-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Key Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Markets Closed:</strong> Equities and bond markets are closed today for Presidents Day; expect lower liquidity in futures and global trading.</li>
<li><strong>Chip Supply Crunch:</strong> Reports indicate a growing crisis in memory chip supply driven by rampant AI demand, signaling pricing power for memory manufacturers.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Escalation:</strong> US military boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean enforcing sanctions; Iran signaling potential for new nuclear/energy talks amidst tensions.</li>
<li><strong>Epstein Disclosures:</strong> New files released; while politically noisy, market impact remains negligible unless current C-suite executives are directly implicated.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The Duration Pivot</h3>
<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> The narrative is shifting from &quot;higher for longer&quot; to a definitive mid-year cut.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Outlook:</strong> While a March cut appears off the table, conviction for a June rate cut is hardening. The bond market is front-running this, with the 10-year Treasury yield breaking downside support (moving from ~4.26% toward 4.09%).</li>
<li><strong>Investment Implication:</strong> The path of least resistance for long-duration assets (tech, biotech, long-term treasuries) is up. The steepening of the 10Y-2Y spread suggests the curve is normalizing via the long end coming down, which is bullish for equity valuations.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Overweight growth factors and long-duration fixed income. Fade volatility in short-term rates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics: Energy &amp; Defense Hedges</h3>
<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Kinetic risks in the Middle East are underpriced relative to the frequency of military engagements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East:</strong> High likelihood of Israeli strikes on Iranian proxies or infrastructure in late February. The US boarding of tankers suggests tighter sanction enforcement, which effectively removes supply from the market.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine/Russia:</strong> Russian territorial gains continue; a ceasefire in Q1 is highly unlikely.</li>
<li><strong>Investment Implication:</strong> Oil markets are complacent. Any disruption in the Strait of Hormuz or aggressive sanction enforcement on Iranian exports will spike crude.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain exposure to Defense primes and Energy exploration/production as a portfolio hedge against a geopolitical shock.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Focus: Technology &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> The AI trade is narrowing into specific supply-chain bottlenecks, specifically memory and high-compute hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Memory Crisis:</strong> Headlines regarding a memory chip shortage confirm a &quot;supercycle&quot; thesis. Demand for HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) is outstripping supply. This benefits pure-play memory manufacturers and equipment suppliers over generalized semi names.</li>
<li><strong>NVIDIA Earnings:</strong> Expectations are sky-high for the upcoming print. Betting markets imply a very high probability of a beat. The risk is not the numbers, but the guidance and the market's reaction to &quot;good but not perfect&quot; news.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Long memory semiconductor manufacturers. Hold NVDA into earnings but consider trimming peripheral AI software names that lack hardware moats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> Consolidation amidst macro tailwinds.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Structure:</strong> Bitcoin is consolidating in the low $60k range. The drop in treasury yields is a massive tailwind for non-yielding assets like BTC and Gold.</li>
<li><strong>Adoption:</strong> Institutional flows via ETFs remain the primary driver.</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Accumulate on dips. The macro environment (falling yields + fiscal dominance) remains structurally bullish for hard assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 17 (Tue):</strong> Markets Reopen (Liquidity returns).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 18 (Wed):</strong> FOMC Minutes (Insight into the &quot;June Cut&quot; consensus).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 20 (Fri):</strong> <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA) Earnings Report</strong> (Major market-moving event for Tech/AI).</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28 (Sat):</strong> US Government Funding Deadline (Potential shutdown noise).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 06 (Fri):</strong> February Nonfarm Payrolls (Key for confirming labor market cooling).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11 (Wed):</strong> February CPI Release (Inflation trajectory check).</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18 (Wed):</strong> FOMC Meeting &amp; Rate Decision.</li>
</ul>
