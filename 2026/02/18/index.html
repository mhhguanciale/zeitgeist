    <h1>Daily Memo (18-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Key News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk:</strong> The U.S. has hardened allegations regarding a secret Chinese nuclear test, while simultaneously managing fragile diplomatic talks with Iran and Ukraine. Tensions remain elevated with threats from Iran's Supreme Leader regarding U.S. warships.</li>
<li><strong>Fed &amp; Banking:</strong> The Federal Reserve is proposing loosening bank rules to incentivize mortgage lending, a potential tailwind for regional banks and the housing sector.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Litigation:</strong> Netflix has issued a cease-and-desist to ByteDance regarding AI-generated clips of its IP, signaling the start of aggressive copyright litigation between legacy media and AI platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Weather Impact:</strong> Severe winter storms in the Sierra and Pacific Northwest are disrupting travel and logistics; expect short-term volatility in insurers and regional transport.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Pause then Cut&quot; Pivot</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Outlook:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a rate cut for the March meeting, shifting consensus to a &quot;hold&quot; with easing expected to begin by June. The yield curve continues to steepen (10Y-2Y spread approx. +62 bps), signaling a return to a normalized term structure.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Change:</strong> Kevin Warsh is the overwhelming favorite for the next Fed Chair nomination. His appointment would likely be viewed as market-friendly, favoring deregulation and potentially a more predictable monetary policy path, benefiting financials ($XLF) and broad equities.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Yields:</strong> With the 10Y Treasury yield drifting down toward 4.04% from recent highs, duration exposure ($TLT, $ZROZ) remains attractive. However, inflation expectations for February are firming around 2.4-2.5%, suggesting the &quot;last mile&quot; of inflation control remains sticky.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics: Asymmetric Risk in Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation:</strong> Despite current diplomatic efforts, market sentiment indicates a high likelihood of kinetic military engagement involving Israel, the U.S., and Iran before mid-year.</li>
<li><strong>Oil Disconnect:</strong> WTI Crude is trading softly (~$64), appearing disconnected from the elevated risk of a Strait of Hormuz disruption. Energy equities ($XLE) and commodities ($DBC) offer an asymmetric hedge against a sudden geopolitical shock that the current spot price is ignoring.</li>
<li><strong>Defense Spending:</strong> While a DHS shutdown is highly probable and likely to last over a week, treat any resulting dip in defense contractors ($XAR) as a buying opportunity. The long-term secular trend of re-armament (driven by China/Russia tensions) outweighs domestic budget squabbles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Focus</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Technology &amp; AI:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA):</strong> Earnings are imminent. Expectations are for a beat, but guidance is the critical variable. The market is heavily positioned for continued AI capex expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech:</strong> Alphabet ($GOOGL) is gaining momentum in AI model rankings (Gemini), potentially narrowing the valuation gap with Microsoft ($MSFT).</li>
<li><strong>Litigation Risk:</strong> The Netflix/ByteDance dispute highlights growing legal risks for AI platforms regarding IP. Monitor content-heavy tech names for similar defensive moves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Housing &amp; Financials:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Fed's move to ease mortgage capital requirements is a direct stimulus for the mortgage-backed securities market ($MBB) and homebuilders ($ITB), potentially offsetting headwinds from sticky mortgage rates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market Structure:</strong> Bitcoin ($BTC) is consolidating in the $60k-$64k range. The market anticipates continued institutional inflows via ETFs.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Expect increased regulatory scrutiny or legislative movement regarding USD-backed stablecoins, which could impact liquidity in the broader crypto ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 19 (Tomorrow):</strong> NVIDIA ($NVDA) Quarterly Earnings Report. <em>High impact on broad market sentiment and AI thesis.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 19:</strong> NASA Artemis II fueling test. <em>Impacts aerospace/defense contractors.</em></li>
<li><strong>Feb 20:</strong> Potential Supreme Court movement on Tariff cases. <em>Impacts importers/retail/manufacturing.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 06:</strong> February Nonfarm Payrolls &amp; Unemployment Rate. <em>Key metric for June rate cut probability.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> February CPI Print. <em>Critical for inflation trajectory confirmation.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 18:</strong> FOMC Rate Decision &amp; Press Conference. <em>Expected pause; focus on forward guidance.</em></li>
<li><strong>Mar 31:</strong> Deadline for various geopolitical triggers (Ukraine/Russia talks, potential escalation in Middle East).</li>
</ul>
