    <h1>Daily Memo (10-Feb-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Headlines &amp; Major Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Government Shutdown</strong>: A shutdown is in effect, with high odds it extends several days. This will impact federal contract flows (defense, healthcare), data releases, and short-term Treasury settlement; risk of further political brinkmanship ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Leadership Transition</strong>: High probability of Kevin Warsh nomination and confirmation as Fed Chair by late spring; notably hawkish historical stance, likely signaling a less accommodative rates regime.</li>
<li><strong>Trump Policy Action</strong>: Trump and allies moving rapidly to dismantle climate regulations (full rollback of GHG rules underway), and aggressive posture on border/immigration enforcement (TPS wind-down, deportations).</li>
<li><strong>Middle East Risk</strong>: Israeli government unilaterally expanding control in West Bank; military tensions remain high regionally. Odds of US/Israel strikes on Iran by mid-year continue rising; next 2-6 months are especially sensitive.</li>
<li><strong>China’s Increased Interventionism</strong>: Messaging out of Beijing strongly backing Taiwan “reunification” and preparing for more aggressive cross-strait countermeasures. Bangladesh and other regional states leaning toward China as Indian influence wavers.</li>
<li><strong>Tech Sector Layoffs</strong>: Salesforce, among other names, initiating restructuring—focus on AI investment but rationalizing non-core headcount.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Chip/Semi Shortages</strong>: Ongoing supply constraints for DRAM/NAND, repercussions for PC/server pricing and tech equity dispersion.</li>
<li><strong>Macroeconomic Print Wait</strong>: January CPI and retail sales prints will shape near-term rates/inflation expectations and sector rotation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Broad Macro</h2>
<h3>Policy, Rates, Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Environment</strong>: Fed funds eased to ~3.6%, but market-implied path now implies fewer and later rate cuts for 2026 than previously expected. The acceleration of Kevin Warsh's nomination increases risks of earlier pause or even hawkish surprise post-confirmation.
<ul>
<li>Yield curve (10y–2y) remains modestly positive, but government shutdown headlines and upcoming CPI/PCE could introduce volatility to duration bets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Core inflation remains sticky: Core PCE and Core CPI both running above 3% y/y late last year—still above target. Market debate is now whether disinflation will stall and cause Fed to slow any cuts.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Risk</strong>: Shutdown duration and next CR (continuing resolution) will delay spending and add tail risk for Q1 GDP, but not enough yet to fundamentally shift full-year macro outlook. However, a protracted shutdown could start impacting defense/contracted healthcare flows.</li>
<li><strong>Global FX</strong>: USD remains strong; CNY, JPY, and EUR under persistent pressure as respective central banks (PBOC, BOJ, ECB) are either dovish or seeing sluggish growth (see also Eurozone, Japan, UK GDP below).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Employment &amp; Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Labor Market</strong>: Unemployment running ~4.4% in Dec; December/January payrolls healthy (159.5m, flat m/m) but JOLTS and jobless claims trends indicate slowing labor churn. Market not pricing imminent spike above 5–5.5% despite shutdown fears.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer</strong>: Sentiment remains fragile and well below pre-pandemic norms; real retail sales are treading water. Upside surprises in retail or jobs could spur cyclical rebound, but shutdown and rising gas prices could dent momentum by late February.</li>
<li><strong>Manufacturing/Production</strong>: Industrial production plateaued at low 102s. Manufacturing and ISM readings next two weeks are crucial for cyclicals and industrials allocations.</li>
<li><strong>Housing</strong>: National house price appreciation has stopped rising, with Case-Shiller index essentially flat to down sequentially; supply/demand stalling. Mortgage rates risk spiking again toward 6.5–7% if shutdown or debt ceiling tensions escalate, posing further headwind to REITs and homebuilders.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Thematic Views</h2>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil/Gas</strong>: WTI trades ~$61–$65/bbl, but options skew and geopolitical pricing imply high volatility. OPEC+ and potential Middle East escalation (esp. US/Israel–Iran confrontation) are key near-term catalysts. US energy (XLE) and defense-industrial suppliers will benefit from any sustained spike or supply interruption scenario.</li>
<li><strong>Precious Metals</strong>: Gold and silver trade with “crisis premium” optionality—geopolitics and renewed inflation risk push, but long bond yields retard runaway upside. Near-term, gold is positioned as a relative outperformer if Iran/Israel situation escalates and/or Fed credibility comes under renewed strain.</li>
<li><strong>Agriculture/Climate</strong>: Probability of extreme temperature records this year remains high—watch for upside in ag and softs (corn, wheat, insurance, re/insurance) especially if shutdown impacts federal disaster response or farm programs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech, AI, and Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mega-Cap Tech</strong>: Ongoing leadership with NVDA, MSFT, META, GOOGL all central to AI infrastructure, but index outperformance not guaranteed if runaway inflation or rates whiplashes growth multiples.</li>
<li><strong>AI Hardware/Software</strong>: Continued rapid AI capability ramp (Claude 5, Gemini 3.5 expected soon; major new releases through H1); sector not at risk of downturn, but index performance may diverge if semis remain supply constrained (memory in particular).</li>
<li><strong>IPO Pipeline</strong>: SpaceX IPO probable in H2-2026, with OpenAI and Anthropic to follow. Valuations remain highly elevated.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks, Credit</strong>: Funding strains could surface if government shutdown is prolonged; duration risk remains for regionals with balance sheet exposure to CRE, but overall financial conditions are still fairly loose (Chicago Fed FCI at -0.56).</li>
<li><strong>Housing Finance</strong>: Fannie/Freddie IPO odds rising late this year/early next; legislative risk for MBS/agency flows in focus but not immediate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Geopolitical Risk Names</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense/Contractors</strong>: High risk premium persists due to near-ongoing Middle East escalation and rising Russia/China hard power posture—sustained bipartisan appetite for spending whatever happens politically.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging Markets</strong>: China macro remains structurally weak, with risks of policy intervention and geopolitical noise driving flows. Southeast Asia and South Asia (notably Bangladesh) seeing increasing PRC involvement at the expense of Indian exporters.
<ul>
<li>Latin America: Venezuela succession risk has direct oil supply impact. Monitor for sanctions risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Event-Driven</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Under pressure; likely Q1 delivery shortfall, but longer-term optionality exists (robotaxi and energy business growth possible). Little risk of Musk departure before year-end.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Relative laggard among US megacaps; regulatory, hardware innovation pressure but not acute crisis. Watch for confirmation of Vision Pro rumors and new hardware launches at WWDC as possible catalysts, but don't expect outperformance into aggressive rate signals.</li>
<li><strong>Coinbase/Crypto</strong>: Crypto flows remain robust, but heightened event risk from possible ETF outflows if macro backdrop sours (correlations elevated to risk assets).</li>
<li><strong>Retail/App Earnings</strong>: Near-term, “Magnificent 7” are reigning, but sector rotation likely if shutdown- or inflation-induced consumer retrenchment materializes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Risks/Potential Surprises</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shutdown “Tail”</strong>: A shutdown pushing past two weeks increases the probability of market shocks—trend followers need to respect a sharp rise in equity and rate volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Hawkish Reversal</strong>: Warsh assuming chair could bring forward a pause/cut cycle, raise medium-term upside yield risk.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East “Pop”</strong>: A US/Israel strike on Iran would rapidly reprice oil/gold, disrupt USD funding, and trigger global risk-off.</li>
<li><strong>China/Taiwan</strong>: Reunification push increases risk of accidental escalation; any US ban/sanction/tariff move prompts CNY volatility—semis/EM overweights vulnerable.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto Regulation</strong>: High odds of new regulatory headlines (US SEC enforcement, ETF approvals/rejections, EU/Asia jurisdictional news). Watch for whipsaw moves in BTC/ETH and related stocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 11</strong>: January US CPI—crucial for near-term rates/inflation expectations, will set sector tone.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 13</strong>: January US Retail Sales—indicator for consumer cyclicals/defensive rotation.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 14</strong>: US Corporate 13F filings deadline—early read on hedge fund and fast money positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 18</strong>: January US PPI—confirmation/disconfirmation of cost-push inflation themes for industrial equities/credit spreads.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 27</strong>: January US PCE/Core PCE—key input for Fed's monetary stance and market's inflation expectations path.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 6</strong>: February US payrolls/unemployment—critical for labor market trending and rate cut odds.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 12</strong>: ECB governing council meeting—likely influences EUR/USD, eurozone multinationals’ momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 16–19</strong>: Nvidia GTC Developer Conference—potential AI sector volatility, single-stock/NVDA impact.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18–19</strong>: FOMC meeting &amp; press conference—Warsh policy guidance likely; could alter duration and growth asset risk premiums.</li>
<li><strong>April–May</strong>: Major US bank and tech earnings—focus on credit trends, labor cost commentary, AI capex updates.</li>
<li><strong>Spring</strong>: Successive monthly CPI/PCE/Payrolls dates—as above, each with potential to decisively impact the rates/inflation narrative.</li>
<li><strong>May/June</strong>: Next Treasury refunding—implications for long-dated yields and risk of curve steepening if supply outstrips demand amid budget and shutdown uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Late Q2</strong>: Possible Fannie/Freddie IPO signals—MBS/agency REIT sensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing through midyear</strong>: SCOTUS regulatory decisions, US–China/tech/trade talks, OPEC+ meetings—constant tail volatility for semis, energy, and headline-driven risk gauges.</li>
