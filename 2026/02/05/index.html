<h2>Macro &amp; Market Outlook</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Growth &amp; Labor</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>FRED unemployment for Dec 2025: 4.4% (modestly rising from mid-year lows); continuing claims drifting lower, but not dramatically so.</li>
<li>Nonfarm payrolls have stabilized but are not growing rapidly; job openings drifting off peak, though still historically elevated.</li>
<li>Probability of US recession starting in 2026 remains well below 25%; prediction markets heavily favor &gt;2.5% GDP growth for 2026 and 2025—cyclical strength remains the base case, albeit with more volatility.</li>
<li>PCE/core inflation remains sticky (latest FRED: 2.6–2.7% YoY run-rate); markets expect full-year 2026 inflation to stay at or near 3% with upside risk in H2.</li>
<li>Next CPI/PCE prints and the March payrolls will be direct risk events for rate/dollar/consumer exposure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rates &amp; Credit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets favor 2–3 rate cuts this year (base case: rates move gradually lower but zero not in play).</li>
<li>10Y/2Y Treasury spread is positive and rising (now +70bp); yield curve is normalizing, alleviating tail risk of sharp recession/credit shock, but raises duration and mortgage convexity risk.</li>
<li>Treasury and MBS supply will stay heavy through spring; another government funding fight is approaching (again, focus on short T-bill supply and potential funding premium in March/April).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer &amp; Housing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Retail sales trend (FRED): holding up, but consumer sentiment remains poor (FRED: Michigan sentiment still in low-50s).</li>
<li>Home price indices showing flat-to-mild decline since early 2025, but not a disorderly housing reset.</li>
<li>30Y mortgage rates likely stuck in the 6.0–6.5% range for H1; limited room for homebuilders/REITs rally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>International</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Political &amp; Currency</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US/EU/UK: Next round of central bank meetings (ECB, BoJ) in March; base case for hold or mild dovish pivot.</li>
<li>EUR/USD expected to trade in wide 1.12–1.26 band; dollar remains structurally supported by US growth, but the euro is at risk of episodic rallies if Fed pivots hard.</li>
<li>EM: South Korea equity/fx futures whipsawed on global tech/crypto risk-off. China trade and monetary signals are mixed; Xi’s political focus on Taiwan escalation is destabilizing for foreign equity flows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodities</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>WTI crude running $62–64/bbl (FRED); OPEC+ meeting/production news, plus any US or Israel escalations in Middle East, are direct tactical oil catalysts.</li>
<li>Silver, gold, and copper very volatile; gold futures have strong upside skew (over $5,000/oz by summer possible if inflation expectations and risk-off collide).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic Update</h2>
<h3>Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>AI</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>“AI Run”: Market narrative still strong for generative AI platform/semiconductor leaders, even as multiples are compressing in legacy SaaS and low-tier hardware.</li>
<li>Google’s Gemini remains leading model by most benchmarks this month; OpenAI and xAI are in competitive chase but not consensus leaders for Q1 (“AI winner take most” narrative is keeping NVDA/GOOGL/MSFT as pivotal).</li>
<li>AI hardware/infra valuations (SpaceX, Anduril, OpenAI): prediction markets still expect high-probability mega-IPOs ($NVDA, $GOOGL, $MSFT likely involved as major partners/customers), supporting premium multiples for US-listed ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>US Tech Megacaps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing legal/regulatory headwinds for Big Tech. SCOTUS greenlit CA voting map, which preserves status quo power for Dems, but House likely to push for new antitrust and tech regulation.</li>
<li>Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon all face competitive and regulatory tests in Q1 earnings.</li>
<li>“AI is killing B2B SaaS” meme is gaining mindshare, putting further pressure on small/mid-cap cloud multiples.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Crypto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin/ETH/SOL highly volatile; mega-cap outflows; record ETF inflows decelerating.</li>
<li>No regulatory “ban” price panic, but credit jitters and capital rotation are headline risks (especially if the US takes a hostile stance toward stablecoins).</li>
<li>Multiple “depeg” events for major US and Asian stablecoins are priced as tail risk (monitor for any banking/FI/DeFi contagion headlines).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense, Energy, Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Defense</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle East risk premium is back on: escalation pathways in Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen, and Iran are all active (“probability of US/Israel-Iran direct strike by June” now 50%+ for market purposes).</li>
<li>Anduril and other US defense tech players seen as probable government equity/takeover candidates; DoD industrial policy and supply chain onshoring are live themes for 2026–27.</li>
<li>Ongoing risk for contractors/government services amid budget cliff and ICE/DHS rollbacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil/Energy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil and natgas both skittish; upside tail on WTI if Middle East strikes expand to Iran or Strait of Hormuz threatening even as base case is range-bound $60–66/bbl.</li>
<li>Silver, copper, uranium see major tactical flows on both reflation and supply risks.</li>
<li>Clean energy policy in US/EU/EM takes a back seat short term to grid/fuel security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Industrials/US Manufacturing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Favor structurally in-shoring names for H1; PMI/stimulus-driven rally not likely until later spring if jobs and consumer data holds up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing, Financials, Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Housing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage rates stuck above 6%; affordability squeeze.</li>
<li>Homebuilder outlook subdued, but no disorderly housing correction short term.</li>
<li>MBS supply, Treasury curve normalization remain the critical side theme for insurance and mortgage REITs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Banks/Financials</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regional bank failure risk repriced higher; another failure or major credit event by quarter-end viewed as moderate likelihood.</li>
<li>Money center/mega cap US banks solid due to Fed backstopping and positive yield curve.</li>
<li>Commercial real estate/mortgage exposure is not yet systemic but remains the top market concern for midcaps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Consumer/Healthcare</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retailers/consumer names with strong value and digital franchises outperforming.</li>
<li>Healthcare and pharma moderate; insurers benefit as ACA tax credits not extended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Special Situations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AAPL</strong>: Outperforms “Mag 7” peers this week, upside catalyst is March product supercycle/AI hardware.</li>
<li><strong>NVDA</strong>: Leader for mega-cap AI equity momentum and options flow.</li>
<li><strong>AMZN</strong>: Facing both legal (antitrust) and AWS confidence controversies but continues to capture mindshare in GenAI and consumer retail spend.</li>
<li><strong>PLTR</strong>: High conviction for government AI for defense/cyber and as a dark horse beneficiary if US federal “strategic stakes” are announced.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA</strong>: Production outlook solid on commercial side, but consumer demand subdued; robotaxi/AI hype not converting to equity inflows in Q1.</li>
<li><strong>MSTR</strong>: Continues as the high-beta “Bitcoin vehicle”; more variability and regulatory/sentiment downside.</li>
<li><strong>Anduril, SpaceX, OpenAI, Discord, Stripe, Anthropic</strong>: Highly anticipated IPOs, with government exposure driving valuation spreads.</li>
</ul>
