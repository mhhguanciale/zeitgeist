    <h1>Daily Memo (26-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News &amp; Market Drivers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Escalation:</strong> US military deployment sweeping into Europe/Middle East as administration weighs strikes on Iran; nuclear talks in Geneva facing &quot;big lies&quot; accusations.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Shock:</strong> Severe rare earth shortages reported in US aerospace and chip sectors despite trade truces; China masking drone flights near Taiwan suggests continued pressure.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Policy:</strong> Trump administration withholding $259M in Minnesota Medicaid funds citing fraud; signals aggressive executive action on spending.</li>
<li><strong>Monetary Divergence:</strong> Yen weakens significantly as Japan PM picks dovish BOJ candidates, reigniting carry trade dynamics.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> Salesforce shares sink on mixed guidance; Nvidia earnings continue to soothe AI slowdown fears despite supply constraints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Macro Thesis: The War Premium &amp; Yield Curve</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risk Premium:</strong> Prediction markets are pricing in a significant probability (&gt;40%) of kinetic engagement between the US/Israel and Iran by end of Q1 2026. This is currently underpriced in broad indices ($SPY), which remain near highs.
<ul>
<li><em>Action:</em> Maintain overweight exposure to Energy ($XLE) and Defense ($XAR) as hedges against a spike in oil or asymmetric conflict.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interest Rates &amp; FX:</strong> The 10Y yield holding ~4.04% with the 2Y at ~3.43% (FRED data) keeps the curve inverted. The weakening Yen provides short-term liquidity relief to global markets (carry trade), but increases volatility for US multinationals with Asian exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Outlook:</strong> With Core CPI trending ~332 (FRED), inflation remains sticky. A potential oil supply shock from Iran/Venezuela tensions would force the Fed to hold rates higher for longer, punishing long-duration assets ($TLT).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Aerospace ($XAR, $ITA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Bullish. The convergence of rare earth shortages (critical for guidance systems/jets) and high probability of near-term conflict (Iran, Ukraine) creates pricing power for prime contractors.</li>
<li><strong>Risk:</strong> Supply chain bottlenecks could hamper delivery, but order books will swell.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare ($XLV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Bearish/Caution. The administration's move to withhold Medicaid funds from Minnesota is a precedent-setting event.</li>
<li><strong>2nd Order Effect:</strong> Expect increased volatility for Managed Care Organizations (MCOs) and hospital REITs dependent on government reimbursement flows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Semiconductors &amp; AI ($SOXX)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Neutral/Selective. While demand remains high (Nvidia earnings), the &quot;rare earth shortage&quot; headline is a critical supply-side warning. China's dominance in this supply chain makes the sector vulnerable to retaliatory export controls if US-China tensions flare over Taiwan drone activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy ($XLE, $DBC)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Thesis:</strong> Bullish. Venezuelan production targets (1m+ bpd) are optimistic given political instability, and Middle East risk is acute. Oil markets are likely complacent regarding a potential Strait of Hormuz disruption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Markets imply a consolidation phase ($60k-$70k range). Correlation with risk assets remains high; however, if geopolitical instability spikes, monitor for a decoupling as a &quot;digital gold&quot; flight to safety, though USD strength usually acts as a headwind.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Remains the preferred hedge over crypto for immediate geopolitical kinetic risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>February 28, 2026:</strong> Deadline for potential US/Israel strike on Iran (implied by high prediction market activity).</li>
<li><strong>March 3, 2026:</strong> US Super Tuesday Primaries (Key gauge for 2026 Midterm sentiment).</li>
<li><strong>March 6, 2026:</strong> February Nonfarm Payrolls &amp; Unemployment Report.</li>
<li><strong>March 11, 2026:</strong> February CPI Release.</li>
<li><strong>March 17-18, 2026:</strong> FOMC Meeting and Rate Decision.</li>
<li><strong>Late March 2026:</strong> Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Meeting (Watch for yield curve control adjustments).</li>
<li><strong>Late April 2026:</strong> US Q1 2026 GDP Advance Estimate.</li>
<li><strong>May 2026:</strong> US Treasury Quarterly Refunding Announcement.</li>
</ul>
