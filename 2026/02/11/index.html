    <h1>Daily Memo (11-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h2>Key News Summaries</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Epstein Files Fallout</strong>: New disclosures in the Epstein case are fueling significant political/media controversy, with new names implicated, including prominent US and UK business and political figures. No direct market fallout yet, but headline risk remains, particularly for named public companies (JPMorgan, News Corp, Microsoft, Tesla, Google).</li>
<li><strong>US–Iran/Israel Tensions</strong>: High probability the US or Israel takes further direct military actions targeting Iranian assets (including oil infrastructure, possible tanker seizures) in coming months. Trump administration vocal on opposing formal annexation moves by Israel.</li>
<li><strong>China Macro Signals</strong>: January CPI/Producer Prices indicate continued weak domestic pricing power and persistent deflation; small uptick in consumer inflation, but not sufficient to trigger positive macro sentiment. PBOC maintaining accommodative bias.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration, Voting Regulation</strong>: House oversight hearings and the possible SAVE Act draw focus on possible changes in federal approach to both immigration/border enforcement and voting access; impact on consumer, labor, and logistics sectors.</li>
<li><strong>US Jobs, Tariffs, and Trade</strong>: Key jobs data delayed, retail sales on deck. Ford faces large ($900M) tariff hit. Continued discussions around further of targeted tariffs, especially with respect to China and AI-related products. US–China, US–EU, and US–Canada trade dialogues upcoming.</li>
<li><strong>Climate/EPA</strong>: EPA signals reversal of Obama-era greenhouse gas endangerment finding, indicating climate regulations will be loosened. Medium-term implications for traditional energy, autos, and some industrials.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Macro &amp; Markets</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth &amp; Labor</strong>
<ul>
<li>Latest FREDs show unemployment at ~4.4% in Dec, rising trend against prior year.</li>
<li>Payrolls remain flat-to-down, jobless claims ticking up, JOLTS openings declining.</li>
<li>Prediction markets see recession risk this year as low (&lt;25%), with a base case for moderate GDP growth (2026 widely seen in the 1.5–2.5% range).</li>
<li>Labor cooling evident—wage pressures, hiring, and openings down, but not collapsing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation &amp; Rates</strong>
<ul>
<li>FRED: Core CPI and PCE still sticky, annualizing ~3–3.5% over past 6 months, decelerating slightly but not near 2% target.</li>
<li>Next CPI print (Feb-13) critical for near-term rates outlook.</li>
<li>Market expects Fed to hold rates stable through Q1 and Q2, with cuts possible but not certain in H2 (base case: 1–2 cuts by year-end).</li>
<li>Yield curve steepening modestly (10Y-2Y spread positive ~70bps), but not suggestive of extreme risk pricing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal &amp; Political Risk</strong>
<ul>
<li>US government shutdown remains a live risk; probability high for at least a short-duration event this month. Fiscal deadlines in May–June (debt ceiling, 2027 extraordinary measures).</li>
<li>No major government spending cuts expected before 2027; stimulus bias moderately negative, but no crash scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China</strong>: Weak macro data (deflation, stalling GDP/credit) continues to weigh on CNY, Asian equities.</li>
<li><strong>Europe/UK</strong>: ECB seen on hold for now; Eurozone and UK growth soft but not recessionary. Regulatory overhang (climate, migration, political volatility) in France and UK.</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>: Signs of persistent yen softness; BOJ likely staying dovish, supporting carry; Nikkei/USD performance remains intact.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Oil stable ($60–65 WTI), but with upside tail risk if US/Iran escalate. OPEC+ meeting in June an inflection point.</li>
<li>Gold and precious metals elevated: flight-to-safety and inflation hedge themes remain, aided by global political risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Major Themes &amp; Sector Impacts</h2>
<h3>Rates, Bonds, &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasuries</strong>: 10Y yield stable around 4.2–4.3% (FRED), market sees low probability of &gt;2 rate cuts in 2026; sticky inflation limits upside for long bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Credit Event</strong>: Elevated chatter on potential for additional regional bank failures, but no imminent stress in financial conditions (FRED: Chicago Financial Conditions index at extremes of 'loose'). Real threat would arise from a political shutdown + delayed debt ceiling.</li>
<li><strong>Mortgage &amp; Housing</strong>: 30Y mortgages above 6%, FRED Case-Shiller shows home prices plateauing, but not under material pressure. REITs exposed to rate volatility.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Indexes (SPX, NDX) bid up on soft landing scenario—market odds for S&amp;P 500 to end 2026 &gt;7000 are strong, but with increased tail risk of a 6600-level drawdown in the event of macro shocks (e.g., shutdown, unexpected Fed action, or geopolitics).</li>
<li>Rotations out of software and AI-exposed names on valuation/capex concerns; flows move toward financials, physical infrastructure, and energy/resource sectors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap Tech</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Nvidia remains in global leadership position (market expects it to keep 'largest co.' title into Q2). Sentiment swings driven by next 1–2 earnings, AI regulation risk (US &amp; UK), and ongoing competition from Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI.</li>
<li>Apple/Google/Meta/Amazon: Near-term catalyst is Q1 results (April/May), Apple supply chain updates, and antitrust outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A, Spin-outs &amp; IPOs</strong>:
<ul>
<li>SpaceX and Anthropic IPOs anticipated in 2026; possible record market caps. OpenAI timing more uncertain but could slot in late-year.</li>
<li>Warner Bros. in play, with Netflix and Paramount leading acquirer odds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thematic/Disruptive Sectors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI model upgrade pace remains brisk; Anthropic, Google, and xAI expected to release major new models by mid-year.</li>
<li>Monetization and regulatory risk are both rising: Congress/FTC/SCOTUS likely to advance regulation or antitrust actions over 2026–27. Potential for US government to take direct stakes in 'critical' AI/defense/semiconductor companies.</li>
<li>Risk: Lawsuits and liability/insurance exposure (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy, Climate, and Geo-Risk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oil range-bound, but subject to high-tension Mideast tail risk. EPA regulatory rollback will marginally benefit fossil fuel/industrial exposure, but not enough for a secular theme shift.</li>
<li>Renewable development continues, with large US solar buildouts probable in 2025 but less clear after.</li>
<li>Ukraine, Middle East, and South China Sea remain hot zones—no imminent escalations priced, but probability of surprise remains (US/Iran, Israel-Lebanon, China-Taiwan, Taiwan straits).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC, ETH, SOL</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Expect short-term volatility. Spot ETF inflows positive for BTC; macro view is &gt;$60k base, with risk of both sharp upside (to $75k+) and sharp breakdown ($40–50k).</li>
<li>ETH and SOL: Lower conviction than BTC, but upside scenario if macro/ETF flows return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Silver</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Supported by macro/political risk and modest real yields; gold targeting $5,000–$6,000 range this cycle, with breakouts possible on crisis headlines.</li>
<li>Silver/commodities exposed to macro risk-off and supply chain breaks; tail risk in electrification/industrial use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company/Name-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banking/Financials</strong>: JPMorgan CEO succession remains a focus (Marianne Lake most probable successor); next macro risk is a possible early summer debt ceiling standoff.</li>
<li><strong>Tech</strong>: Antitrust suits remain live for Amazon, Apple; regulatory overhang and possible FTC actions against Microsoft, Tesla, Meta, Google.</li>
<li><strong>Autos/Industrial</strong>: Ford faces large ($900M) tariff hit. Tesla headlines increasingly about robotaxis, energy storage, not just auto deliveries. M&amp;A risk and bankruptcy probability rising for several EV startups (Lucid, Rivian).</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Drug pricing, Type 1 diabetes breakthroughs, and Save/FSA legislation (low odds of near-term passage) matter for managed care and life sciences.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming/Media</strong>: Warner Bros., Paramount, and Netflix M&amp;A in high focus, especially in context of possible all-AI-generated content launches.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2nd/3rd Order Observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Political/legal shocks (Epstein, election regulation, immigration) carry real, not just headline, risk for consumer, media, and select tech names.</li>
<li>Labor and consumer metrics remain pivotal for credit, retail, and housing sentiment—watch for inflection in next few CPI/jobs/retail sales releases.</li>
<li>Regulatory rollbacks on energy/climate could slow US transition investment, slightly favoring mid-term traditional energy equities.</li>
<li>Continued downward trend in financial conditions is a double-edged sword: supports risk assets unless/until a macro/GOVT shock emerges; accentuates duration and curve risk for fixed income.</li>
<li>The IPO/M&amp;A pipeline is a source of liquidity but also creates significant sector dislocation potential (AI, defense, media, fintech).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
