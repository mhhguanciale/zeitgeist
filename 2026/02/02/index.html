<h2>Macro and Markets</h2>
<h3>US Macro Backdrop</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Softening but resilient labor market</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dec non-farm payrolls (FRED): Marginal sequential increase/mo, but JOLTS job openings fell below 7.2M in Nov (down YoY).</li>
<li>Unemployment rate end-2025 ~4.4%. Forecasts and market expectations for Jan show drift higher into 4.5–4.7% zone, per both FRED and market sentiment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI and PCE December: Running at a stable but sticky pace, with monthly prints consistent with YoY just above 3%. Market expects January CPI to stay in the 2.4–2.6% range, some risk to the upside if energy/food pressures persist following storms.</li>
<li>Multiple upcoming CPI/PCE releases over the next month are major catalysts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rates / Yield Curve</strong>
<ul>
<li>FRED: 2Y 3.56%, 10Y 4.22%, bear-steepening in January but curve still positive.</li>
<li>Market expects continued “pause” or modest easing, but no consensus on aggressive cuts until mid-year.</li>
<li>Forward curve, Fed futures, and predictions price significant rate cuts by year-end, not imminent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financial Conditions</strong>
<ul>
<li>Chicago Fed index: Loosening continued into late January, at lowest (most accommodative) in a year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Slight labor cooling but no abrupt deterioration—recession pricing is not yet dominant, but consumer sectors more vulnerable on the margin.</li>
<li>Soft landing and sideways risk remain; sticky inflation and modest labor tightening limit Fed’s flexibility to ease rapidly.</li>
<li>Incr. risk of policy error or upside inflation “surprise” if energy/food shocks from weather propagate.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Mideast &amp; Oil</h3>
<ul>
<li>New escalation signals: Iran escalation (EU armies as terrorist groups), Israel closing Rafah to MSF, and active US/Israel operations through regional proxies. Option-implied volatility on oil is up; risk premium building for Gulf/Red Sea.</li>
<li>Gaza and Lebanon: Expected to remain headlines risk, with secondary impacts to shipping, defense, and energy midstream.</li>
</ul>
<h3>East Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Japan LDP majority and JPY/JPY stability—less near-term FX or sovereign risk.</li>
<li>No market expectation for near-term China-Taiwan military escalation, but tensions persist. Most macro risk is centered on semis (chip supply, insurance, defense).</li>
<li>China’s annual inflation and GDP seen stable/low, and markets not pricing sharp regime change or coup risk before 2027.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors and Thematics</h2>
<h3>US Equities, Rates &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Equity range (S&amp;P, Nasdaq):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P: High scenario 7,800–8,000 this year; low scenario 6,100–6,400.</li>
<li>Nasdaq: Expected to trade 24,000–29,000 range on closing prices by year-end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key Risks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Macro risk-off events (shutdown, Mideast, Fed surprise, credit event) could drive spike in volatility, favoring gold, TIPS, and out-of-the-money equity puts.</li>
<li>Policy/Regulation: Tech/Big Cap remain under scrutiny (AI, antitrust, e-commerce).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selected Predictions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>US not projected to hit a recession in 2026, though elevated tail risk.</li>
<li>Fed leadership likely to turn over to Kevin Warsh by summer, with subsequent bias toward moderate easing but not aggressive cuts.</li>
<li>Another major US bank failure not imminent, but still running above historical average probability for the quarter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities/Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> WTI stabilizing near $60–62/bbl despite Mideast risk, but political/military risk is rising.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Silver:</strong> Recent pullback but bullish longer horizon as real yields roll over and geopolitical risk rises.</li>
<li><strong>Softs/Ags:</strong> Weather, especially in the South, could ripple into CPI/PPI prints and earnings for consumer/food.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto/Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Bitcoin in $74–78K “sticky” range, with shallow downside risk in February. Regulatory headlines, ETF flows, US fiscal/credit uncertainty, and Fed policy are all in play.</li>
<li><strong>New launches and tokens:</strong> Several major airdrops and product launches may generate sector-specific trades, but not broad macro implications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Assets &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Housing:</strong> Case-Shiller index flattish through Q4. High home values in LA, Miami, and NYC, but not making new highs; regional variation rising as insurance/losses from storms bite.</li>
<li><strong>REITs:</strong> Under pressure from high but flattening rates environment; regional REITs in the South could see weather disruption risk; office/urban REITs exposed to new political protests and urban disorder headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single-Stock &amp; Named Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple:</strong> Foldable phone rumors as potential product cycle catalyst (and supply chain risk); Q1 results and end-of-month earnings in tech mega-cap basket remain a top volatility event.</li>
<li><strong>Meta:</strong> US state trial underway on child protection issues (first such standalone case); meaningful headline and regulatory volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> AI/robotics and autonomy events may be slated for upcoming months; ongoing questions about ambition vs. execution.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia:</strong> High expected volatility around AI leadership, hardware launches, and passage of critical export-control or AI-chip regulations.</li>
<li><strong>Banks &amp; Credit:</strong> High, but not crisis-level, probability of another regional bank event by the end of Q1.</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI, SpaceX, Anthropic:</strong> IPO timing remains highly uncertain, but unlikely before mid-year.</li>
<li><strong>Travel/Leisure:</strong> Airlines and tourism exposed to rolling climate/weather events (power loss, insurance risk, spot fare volatility).</li>
<li><strong>Food staples:</strong> Weather- and disease-related CPI upside risk present but not yet in realized data.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>2nd &amp; 3rd Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weather/Infrastructure:</strong> Power failures and storms disrupt local economies, boost utilities’ O&amp;M costs, stress insurers.</li>
<li><strong>Measles outbreaks:</strong> Negative for consumer sentiment, discretionary travel, and public event stocks; could hit local GDP and retail if outbreak grows.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration/political risk:</strong> Urban disorder, ICE enforcement—may impact specific city/REIT pricing, insurance underwriting, hospital systems and large city labor supply/demand.</li>
<li><strong>Japan stability:</strong> Yields and FX risk contained for now, keeping foreign bid for Treasuries intact and risk-on in US/EM.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East energy premium:</strong> Risk of new shock higher in oil if conflict jumps to new front (Hormuz, Lebanon, Iraq)—would drive inflation, hurt consumer, boost select energy and defense.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong><br />
Winter storm disruptions and public health risks may short-cycle labor supply and consumer spending in the South. Macro continues to trend &quot;soft landing&quot; but sticky CPI and wage data will test the easing narrative as supply-side shocks filter through. Mideast events create energy/vol tail risks but are not yet pricing a full crisis regime. Watch for high-impact data over the next 2–3 weeks (NFP, CPI, earnings), and expect volatility in core tech, financials, and consumer sectors as both climate and legal/immigration risk headlines run hot.</p>
