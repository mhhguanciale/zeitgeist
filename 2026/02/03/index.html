<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Forward market-implied GDP growth for 2026 is solidly &gt;2.5%. No credible probability of large contraction this year.</li>
<li>FRED: Nonfarm payrolls stable at ~159.5M; recent months show no major trend break.</li>
<li>Unemployment—latest FRED: 4.4% (Dec); prediction markets expect a move toward 5% by late 2026.</li>
<li>Yield curve steepening slightly: 10y-2y spread now +0.7; steepest in 18+ months; little recession signal for near term.</li>
<li>CPI (Core) and PCE: Rising but not out of control—latest Dec Core CPI prints up sequentially (331.86 vs 331.07 in Nov).</li>
<li>Major inflation prints (CPI, PPI, PCE) due within next 3 weeks; risk of sticky prints and volatile Fed expectations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>RBA surprises markets with a hike. Pressure on BoJ, ECB to adjust dovish guidance may increase if EM inflation data heats up.</li>
<li>China: GDP growth widely expected &gt;4% for 2026 (prediction markets), but leadership consolidation and regulatory unpredictability drive risk premium for CNY, equities.</li>
<li>European inflation/downgrade risk: Markets price substantial chance of at least one eurozone sovereign downgrade before 2027.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Policy, Fiscal &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>US government funding barely extended with more deadlines approaching; macro and bond traders should expect “shutdown fatigue” volatility in US rates.</li>
<li>Fed path: Median expectation for funds rate by year-end is 2.75–3% (current ~3.64%). Soft, multi-cut scenario.</li>
<li>Odds of a US credit downgrade in 2026 remain significant; potential for re-pricing of long-dated Treasuries and TIPS if realized.</li>
<li>Global debt: US debt to surpass $40T in 2026 is nearly consensus; significant for term premium, FX, and safe haven rotation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic Risks &amp; Sector Views</h2>
<h3>Defense &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing hot war in Ukraine: Russian strikes resume, hitting energy. Any shift in conflict timeline or ceasefire could whipsaw global energy, defense, and grain equities.</li>
<li>Mideast: Probabilities rising that Israel or US will strike Iranian energy/nuclear assets this month—direct oil, gold, defense impacts; escalate tail risk for all risk assets.</li>
<li>Taiwan scenario risk remains above historical norms; China military “purge” → more unpredictable, more centralized command structure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Resources</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil: Prediction markets suggest $60–$70 is the soft floor for WTI, barring Iran-related supply shock.</li>
<li>Commodities: Copper bid as China–EM infrastructure plans remain credible; no material evidence yet of broad metal surplus.</li>
<li>US offshore wind construction restart is bullish for green energy, neutral-to-positive for industrials.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI: Market expects Google Gemini to maintain #1 model position this month/quarter; OpenAI, Anthropic, X.ai pipeline launches in play before Q2, but near-term disruption risk limited.</li>
<li>Chips: Intel’s resurgence in ultrabook CPUs increases competitive pressure in PC/edge datacenter silicon; watch supply chain read-through for NVDA/AMD.</li>
<li>Regulatory: Cybercrime raids on X (Twitter) in France, ongoing FTC/SCOTUS actions targeting Big Tech. Legal risk premium persists for Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Elon-linked assets.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos &amp; Industrials</h3>
<ul>
<li>China moves to ban hidden door handles by 2027—a direct R&amp;D hit to designers who “benchmark” Tesla &amp; EU premium EVs, with knock-on costs for US/Europe for compliance in supply contracts.</li>
<li>Prediction markets heavily discount auto bankruptcies (Workhorse, Lucid) in the EV sector, but no mass extinction event priced for US mainline OEMs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Health, Energy &amp; Insurance</h3>
<ul>
<li>US infectious disease environment active: Measles, high flu, storm activity, and solar flares all raise event risk for insurers, travel, and consumer cyclicals.</li>
<li>Solar activity and new earthquake data point to higher near-term catastrophe risk, especially for California/West Coast REIT and insurance names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual &amp; Corporate Moves</h2>
<ul>
<li>Earnings: Q4 tech/bank results incoming; negative guidance/layoffs in tech remain major risk (prediction markets price near-certainty of higher tech layoffs in 2025 vs 2024).</li>
<li>Bank risk: Modest odds of regional US bank failures/forced combinations this quarter; market not pricing systemic crisis, but lower regional multiples justified.</li>
<li>AI IPOs: Discord, SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic each with &gt;50% probability of IPO before 2027; SpaceX and OpenAI mega-cap IPOs attract most upside sentiment.</li>
<li>Corporate legal risk: Multiple cases against Amazon, Apple, and major platforms for antitrust/monopoly risk progressing.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Fast Movers: Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF flows projected flat/negative at open; BTC on the precipice of $74–$76k test. High intraday volatility.</li>
<li>MEGAETH, Solana, and other large altcoins—FDVs expected to retreat or trade sideways. Altcoin market rotation in play.</li>
<li>Prediction markets anticipate a severe drawdown in altcoin market cap and outperformance by BTC on a 2026 horizon if macro risk rises.</li>
<li>Gold: Price regime $60xx–$62xx (futures) by June is baseline; spike scenario to $6.6k/$7k tied to geopolitical shocks (oil/energy).</li>
<li>Measles/health event risk lightly priced; an actual outbreak would move insurance and select healthcare tickers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Event Watch &amp; Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<h3>Near-Term (Feb–Mar 2026)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nonfarm Payrolls &amp; Unemployment (Feb 6):</strong> Jobs data likely to influence rates, cyclical sector leadership.</li>
<li><strong>US CPI (Feb 10):</strong> Key macro trigger for yields, risk assets; sticky print reignites 50bps cut debate.</li>
<li><strong>US PPI (Feb 13):</strong> Cyclical/industrial sectors move.</li>
<li><strong>Q4 Tech &amp; Bank Earnings:</strong> Large-cap tech guidance, bank credit risk signals matter for QQQ/S&amp;P breadth.</li>
<li><strong>FOMC Rate Decision/Presser (Jan 29):</strong> New forward guidance as dissent risk increases, possibility of rate cut signaling.</li>
<li><strong>US Retail Sales (Feb 17):</strong> Consumer, homebuilders, retail equities.</li>
<li><strong>US Federal Budget Proposal (March):</strong> Tax, healthcare, defense, energy policy updates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spring–Summer 2026</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ongoing US gov funding/appropriations deadlines:</strong> Shutdown volatility possible; watch day-to-day developments.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy SCOTUS Rulings Window (April–June):</strong> Legal/regulation risk for mega-cap tech/health/energy.</li>
<li><strong>ECB/BoJ Policy Meetings:</strong> FX, multi-nat S&amp;P weights.</li>
<li><strong>Treasury Refunding Announcements (May):</strong> Duration supply, potential volatility in long bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Major geopolitical event probability (MidEast, Russia/Ukraine):</strong> Market will reprice quickly with news of strikes or “de-escalation” in hot zones.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin halving/ETF flows:</strong> Expect ongoing volatility and volume-driven moves on big crypto/altcoin names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Active Watch Items</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine escalation or ceasefire:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Immediate impact: defense, oil/gas, grain, European equities, and USD risk assets (spreads).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>US/Israel–Iran scenario:</strong> New activity or response will be a sharp macro catalyst.</li>
<li><strong>China further military/leadership consolidation:</strong> Could set stage for trade, tech restrictions or regional volatility.</li>
<li><strong>US/China tariff actions/reviews:</strong> Semis, supply chains, large cap exporters at risk.</li>
<li><strong>AI major launches, regulation:</strong> Tech multiples, supply chain, and competitive landscape remain in flux.</li>
<li><strong>US Congressional redistricting/Maryland:</strong> Shifts in expected House control—US fiscal and regulatory outlooks may shift.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The short-term fiber of markets is governed by major central bank decisions (especially Fed/ECB/BoJ), labor market/cyclical prints, ongoing tech and industrial earnings, and high-impact but binary geopolitical catalysts (particularly Mideast and Russia/Ukraine). 2026’s macro environment is pricing in modest growth, a positive risk/equity regime, and mild rate-cut cycle—with tail risk seeded by political, regulatory, and event-driven volatility. Discipline and nimble risk management around key data, gov funding, and global event headlines remains critical.</p>
