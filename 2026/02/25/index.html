    <h1>Daily Memo (25-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Politics:</strong> President Trump’s State of the Union focused on &quot;heroes&quot; and avoided major controversies, though the event was marked by protests regarding the Epstein list.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Security alerts issued for Mexico amid cartel violence; Russia opens criminal probe into Telegram founder Pavel Durov.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> Spirit Airlines reaches deal with creditors to exit bankruptcy; Samsung launches Galaxy S26; Shein founder pivots to emphasize Chinese roots ahead of potential supply chain upgrades.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macroeconomic Thesis</h3>
<p><strong>The &quot;Higher for Longer&quot; Pivot Point</strong>
While the FRED data indicates the 10Y Treasury yield has moderated to ~4.03%, the market consensus has shifted regarding the Federal Reserve's immediate path.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate Outlook:</strong> A rate cut in March is effectively off the table. The probability of a cut remains low through April, with <strong>June 2026</strong> now viewed as the primary pivot point for the first 25bps reduction.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Expectations for February CPI (released mid-March) are coalescing around a 2.4% YoY increase. This stickiness supports the Fed's pause.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Policy:</strong> There is a near-certainty (&gt;90% probability) of a 10% US blanket tariff being in effect by March 31. This is a structural headwind for importers and a potential inflationary impulse that could complicate the Fed's dovish turn in H2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risk &amp; Hedges</h3>
<p><strong>Escalation in the Middle East</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran:</strong> Risk premiums are mispriced. While markets are calm, there is a growing consensus (&gt;60% probability) of a US or Israeli strike on Iran by the end of Q1 (March 31).</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Maintain overweight exposure to <strong>Defense ($XAR)</strong> and <strong>Energy ($XLE)</strong>. Oil prices (WTI ~$62.50) are currently reflecting supply fundamentals but ignoring the imminent kinetic risk.</li>
<li><strong>Mexico:</strong> Deteriorating security conditions and potential US anti-cartel operations on foreign soil present a tail risk to North American trade and the MXN.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI ($QQQ)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA):</strong> Earnings beat is highly anticipated (&gt;90% probability). The trade remains crowded but fundamental support is intact.</li>
<li><strong>Apple ($AAPL):</strong> Expect an announcement for the &quot;iPhone 17e&quot; within the next 3 weeks. Hardware refresh cycles remain a key catalyst for the stock.</li>
<li><strong>Epstein Contagion:</strong> Be aware of idiosyncratic reputational risk for major cap leaders (specifically MSFT, JPM, TSLA) tied to the potential release of new Epstein files by Feb 28.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Consumer &amp; Retail</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Divergence:</strong> Expect volatility in retail earnings. <strong>Costco ($COST)</strong> is positioned to beat, while <strong>Lowe’s ($LOW)</strong> faces headwinds. The looming blanket tariff makes the discretionary retail sector unattractive in the medium term.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Consolidating in the $60k-$66k range. The market does not anticipate a breakout to ATH ($100k+) in Q1.</li>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Remains a critical portfolio hedge against the Iran escalation scenario.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feb 26 (Tomorrow):</strong> <strong>US PCE Inflation Report.</strong> Primary gauge for Fed policy; high volatility expected in bonds/currencies.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 28:</strong> <strong>Potential Epstein File Release.</strong> Monitor for executive reputational risk/scandals.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 02:</strong> <strong>ISM Manufacturing PMI.</strong> Gauge for industrial recession risk.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 04:</strong> <strong>Apple NYC Event.</strong> Likely AI/Hardware announcements; key for $AAPL price action.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 06:</strong> <strong>US Employment Situation (Payrolls).</strong> Critical for confirming the &quot;soft landing&quot; thesis.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> <strong>US CPI Inflation Report.</strong> Will confirm if the 2.4% inflation floor is holding.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18-19:</strong> <strong>FOMC Meeting.</strong> Expect a &quot;hawkish hold&quot; with updated dot plots.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 31:</strong> <strong>Tariff Implementation Deadline.</strong> High probability of 10% blanket tariff taking effect.</li>
</ul>
