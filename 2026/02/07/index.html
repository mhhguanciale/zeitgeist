    <h1>Daily Memo (07-Feb-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Flow</h2>
<ul>
<li>US House set for anti-Trump, progressive wave after primary upsets; left-wing energized.</li>
<li>Congress will get full access to unredacted Epstein files next week; political/legal overhang grows for multiple sectors.</li>
<li>EPA approves dicamba herbicide for GM crops—blow to MAHA/environmental agenda, modest positive for agrichemicals, negative sentiment for ESG screeners.</li>
<li>Arms control uncertainty builds: US-Russia nuclear treaty lapses; new escalation risks for defense, energy, and gold; US signals hard line against Iranian enrichment in parallel.</li>
<li>Portugal/Spain battered by Storm Leonardo: infrastructure and agriculture losses, potential insurance/commodity pricing knock-on.</li>
<li>EU pushes for tougher sanctions on Russian oil, targeting shadow fleet, insurance, bank transactions, and export bans; growing market uncertainty for crude flows, eurozone energy.</li>
<li>Chickenpox and measles outbreaks spread in US schools (Hawaii, Northern Virginia), and COVID variant risk flagged; modestly negative for insurers, positive for vaccines/biotech.</li>
<li>US state “millionaire’s tax” and CA billionaire wealth tax moves: large crowd opposition; ongoing pressure on high net worth states, tech/tax flight risk.</li>
<li>US Department of Homeland Security at near-term shutdown risk as Congress struggles to fund operations; rising short-term risk for government suppliers, defense.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Markets</h2>
<h3>Growth, Rates &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Q4-2025 GDP tracking solid, with further Q1-2026 growth expected in the high-2%–mid-3% range; FRED data: core inflation measures remain sticky, core PCE and CPI both above the Fed’s long-term 2% goal.
<ul>
<li>Market-implied expectations now favor multiple Fed rate cuts in H1–H2 2026 (~2–3 cuts), while the current funds rate sits near 3.6%. Yield curve remains positively sloped (10Y-2Y spread ~+70bp).</li>
<li>Recession odds through year-end remain moderate, but risk is being re-rated upward in betting markets as unemployment edges up—unemployment rate has ticked from 4.2% (early 2025) to 4.4–4.5% at end-2025.</li>
<li>Jobless claims and continuing claims have stabilized, but trend remains toward normalization rather than acceleration. Labor market not yet rolling over, but wage pressure likely to ease in H1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Inflation expectations have picked up for this year, with &gt;3% CPI seen as more likely than not; food price volatility likely due to storms and outbreaks.
<ul>
<li>CPI/PCE prints and PPI next week (see catalysts) will be pivotal for confirming/dismissing soft-landing narrative.</li>
<li>M2 growth has re-accelerated, consistent with sticky inflation, but industrial production and housing data do not yet show economic stress.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal/Political</h3>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown near-term risk remains acute (odds above 50% for a &gt;1-day closure by Valentine’s Day); short/mid-term volatility for rate markets, contractors, Treasuries, and downstream risk-appetite.</li>
<li>Fiscal and regulatory pressure on Big Tech (i.e., CA and WA state “millionaires”/billionaire taxes, redistricting in swing states): increased risk of HNW migration, negative for state-level REITs and tax-sensitive sectors.</li>
<li>Epstein files and legal hearings could disrupt multiple large-caps (tech, banks, etc.) if tied to key figures; legal headline risk remains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitics/Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li>EU and US coordination on Russian sanctions expanding; risk of material disruption to Russia’s “shadow fleet” (higher insurance premiums, rerouting, tightening Gulf crude balances); watch crude price volatility.</li>
<li>Iran nuclear, Strait of Hormuz, and Red Sea strike risk elevated—heightened volatility premium in oil, LNG, gold, shipping, and defense sectors.</li>
<li>Macau/Far East travel depends on weather (Storm Leonardo), energy reliability, and shifting security environment.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Factor Themes</h2>
<h3>Mega-Cap Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>US/CA/EU policy risk for Big Tech accelerating: multiple signals of antitrust, regulation, privacy, and AI copyright litigation (Epstein, AI-powered legal discovery, SCOTUS and FTC actions in upcoming months).
<ul>
<li>Tax and fiscal overhang building for tech clusters (CA, WA, NY).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AI sector: Model and hardware innovation pace remains breakneck—Claude 5, Gemini 3.5, GPT-6, DeepSeek V4 launch risk before mid-year. Bar for outperformance is set extremely high.
<ul>
<li>Strong consensus pricing in at least one $1T+ IPO for OpenAI (timing &gt;50% by end 2026). Exploding valuation for Anthropic, OpenAI; risk of bubble unwind in SaaS/infra if sentiment turns.</li>
<li>Nvidia positioned to remain world’s most valuable company by market cap through Q2, supported by continued AI (H100) demand.</li>
<li>Regulatory moves against tech (Congressional trading ban, FTC action) could dent sectoral liquidity/volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consumer-facing platforms (Meta, Google, Apple): all flagging substantive AI-powered product refresh cycles (apps and wearables, Metaverse cuts); near-term top-line risk if ad/capex demand retrenches.</li>
</ul>
<h3>EVs &amp; Autos</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tesla’s core business remains under scrutiny—Q1 production/deliveries expected strong, but Street skeptical on sustained volume growth and margin.
<ul>
<li>Betting markets no longer see upside surprise for Q2–Q3 volume. Roadster deliveries, new model launches, robotaxi/Optimus timing delayed.</li>
<li>Regulatory and trade war risk (China/US tariffs), credit risk rising. Policy upside around battery supply chain on political/industrial alignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Materials &amp; Renewables</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sanctions pose real threat to Russia’s shadow crude fleet; upward price pressure on crude/LNG if enforcement sticks.
<ul>
<li>OPEC+ closely coordinating next moves with US/EU to avoid major shocks; energy equities, gold, and industrial metals benefit from heightened uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Permitting reform and critical-minerals bills in pipeline; US tariffs on critical minerals (wind turbines, etc.) expected within months, favoring US-exposed miners and battery/clean-tech supply chain.</li>
<li>Renewables: 2026 is shaping up to be a record hot year; regulatory and insurance risks in property/REITs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials/Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Federal Reserve chair transition (Warsh confirmation odds high) and upcoming FOMC minutes set rate regime for H1—signs point to a cautious, shallow-cut cycle favoring banks with asset-sensitive balance sheets.
<ul>
<li>Ongoing sovereign downgrade chatter for US, EU, emerging markets; watch for credit spread widening/contagion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heightened litigation risk (Epstein, antitrust, crypto enforcement), plus fiscal squeeze on HNW banking in CA/NY/WA.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pandemic/disruption premium building due to outbreaks (measles, chickenpox, flu uptrends); positive for vaccine and test kit pure-plays, insurance sector must watch for claims spikes.
<ul>
<li>Biotech M&amp;A: ongoing narrative for specialty (obesity drugs, psychedelics, gene editing) tie-in to payer and retail pharma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Trumpcare”/Obamacare: legislative repeal/rollback risk is meaningful but not imminent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Alternative assets at inflection: Market pricing multiple US ETFs for both BTC and ETH, but both face new macro headwinds.
<ul>
<li>Crypto market structure legislation progress remains volatile; high probability of at least one major CEX (exchange) insolvency by end-2026.</li>
<li>Bitcoin seen as outperforming gold over medium term, but volatility risk and skew high—number of S&amp;P 500 companies adding BTC to treasury rising.</li>
<li>Ethereum well-bid but at risk for deep drawdowns if equity/AI risk-off. Solana, DOGE, Chainlink favored for sector rotation/altcoin outperformance in first half.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing/REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Median home price momentum flat/softening in major metros (NYC, Miami, Austin, LA, SF); high mortgage rates (6.7–7%) and limited supply likely to keep affordability low, but major distressed moves not imminent.
<ul>
<li>Single-family institutional restriction legislation risk rising—potential conversion tailwinds for rental REITs, negative for large SFR aggregators.</li>
<li>ESG-driven storm and flood risk is trending up (Portugal/Spain storms, US hurricane outlook).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single-Name/Special Sits</h2>
<ul>
<li>SpaceX and OpenAI: IPOs likely before 2027; SpaceX odds/valuation now topping $1T in pricing. Watch timing/underwriting and multipolar IPO risk (space, AI, alt infra).</li>
<li>CA tax/ballot: Tech/large-cap names (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, META) exposed to HNW/billionaire flight and asset restructuring pressure.</li>
<li>Epic, Discord, Stripe, Kraken, and Anthropic IPOs: expected late 2026/early 2027, but move with tech IPO window volatility.</li>
<li>Defense (Anduril, Lockheed, Boeing): tailwinds from global arms build-up, US/EU Asia rearmament, and Strait of Hormuz risk.</li>
<li>Banks: Jamie Dimon transition window in view at JPMorgan, Marianna Lake favored as next CEO.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical &amp; Event-Driven Considerations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Congress shutdown, FOMC minutes, CPI, PPI, payrolls and retail sales staggered over next 2 weeks: short-term volatility in rates, SPY, QQQ.</li>
<li>Key Supreme Court, redistricting, and tax law decisions hitting March–June: policy risk for healthcare, defense, tech, and financials.</li>
<li>Nvidia/AI conference and Big Tech earnings will drive factor rotation (AI, semis, QQQ); potential for AI/SaaS sector unwind if growth guidance softens further.</li>
<li>Major global macro calendar includes BoJ, ECB, OPEC+: FX and carry-sensitive exposures at risk, especially in EUR/JPY and EM.</li>
<li>Crypto: Expect continued ETF-driven inflows to BTC, heavy rotation to altcoins (SOL, LINK) and sector-specific tokens after regulatory decisions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
