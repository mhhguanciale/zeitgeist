    <h1>Daily Memo (06-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US/Russia arms agreement:</strong> US and Russia to observe New START limits after formal expiration, slowing immediate nuclear risk escalation but likely increasing long-term arms uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>US military actions escalate:</strong> US conducted another lethal strike in the eastern Pacific; hints at continued kinetic responses impacting risk assets and energy shipping.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration gridlock:</strong> Senate divisions over DHS/ICE funding create real government shutdown risk (impacting Treasuries, defense contractors, and headline risk to markets).</li>
<li><strong>Japan snap election (Takaichi):</strong> Pro-conservative landslide expected; despite high approval, yen remains headline-sensitive to global risk and US trade policies.</li>
<li><strong>Famine and instability in Sudan:</strong> Worsening famine raises EM risk (grain, softs, insurance exposure), with limited market readthrough beyond regional humanitarian headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Canadian EV policy reversal/car industry:</strong> Canada pivots on EV mandates due to Trump tariff threat, with Carney signaling investment detour and supply chain recalibration—watch North American automakers, US/Canada border zone, and commodity inputs.</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap tech and AI:</strong> Amazon-led US tech pullback on labor/A.I. concerns. US indices under pressure; risk rotation toward defensives, staples, and commodities accelerating.</li>
<li><strong>Legal risk for US Tech/Platform stocks:</strong> Uber verdict sets stage for mass liability litigations; direct implications for gig economy and insurance pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Fed/DOJ on Powell:</strong> Key GOP Senators dismiss DOJ probe into Powell as criminal; lowers near-term odds of policy/Fed leadership shock but underlying political risk persists.</li>
<li><strong>iPhone 18 imminent:</strong> Supply chain data points to new iPhone launch (with design, price, and MagSafe changes), supporting Apple ecosystem revenue expectations into first half.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple, high-profile labor actions/services disruption:</strong> TSA check-ins/labor, critical Cloudflare incidents, and successive corporate earnings lawsuits—operational risk is a recurring market theme.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro: Broad Market and Rates</h2>
<h3>US Macro (Growth, Inflation, Policy)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soft landing thesis remains, but pockets of vulnerability are showing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI and PCE trends through year-end still point to sticky, but moderating, inflation (core CPI climbed to 331.8 in December, core PCE at 127.4 in November).</li>
<li>Unemployment levels drifting higher (now ~4.4% in year-end data) but not at &quot;danger&quot; territory; labor markets softening yet no collapse.</li>
<li>Yield curve is de-inverting (10Y-2Y spread at +0.7%)—typically signals pre-recession or reflation regime.</li>
<li>Financial conditions remain loose (Chicago Fed -0.56) but consumer sentiment flat/weak (Michigan 53), consistent with late-cycle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy Path:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple cuts in 2026 are priced as plausible (base case: 2–3 cuts). Current FOMC still tilted toward gradualism amid inflation persistence. Path to sub-3% fed funds this year is visible but not assured.</li>
<li>Market risk: &quot;pause-pause-cut&quot; sequence is highest probability for near term, barring data shock.</li>
<li>Market expectation persists for the Fed to preserve real yields, keeping long-duration Treasuries rangebound near current 4.25–4.3% (10Y).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Risks:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Fiscal noise from shutdown risks (DHS funding) plays directly into Treasuries, front-end volatility, and could drive equity risk premiums.</li>
<li>No imminent catalyst for a sharp labor market crack, but continued drifting up in jobless claims (~1.84M) tells you not to dismiss recession odds (25% chance seen for 2026).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan:</strong> LDP's dominance post-Takaichi landslide increases probability of stimulus and industrial support, but USDJPY still driven by US rates and global equity risk. Election reduces JPY upside tail.</li>
<li><strong>Eurozone:</strong> Growth-stagnant/weak (Q1 GDP bands mostly tracking 0.5–1.6%), contentious ECB path with at least one rate cut likely in first half. Germany remains weak point (recession risk at 85% for 2026).</li>
<li><strong>China:</strong> Ongoing pressure on CNY, inflation tracking barely positive, leadership transitions highly unlikely near-term. Supply chain/Foxconn/EV exposures remain at risk from further tariffs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Asset Class Perspectives</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Major Indices:</strong>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P/NDX range-bound; risk tilted negative on near-term bases. Large-cap tech is under cyclical and regulatory pressure (AI, labor, platform legal risk).</li>
<li>Defensive and cyclical rotation likely: Staples, industrials, energy gain relative positioning, while high-multiple tech remains vulnerable.</li>
<li>Geopolitical headline risk: Middle East and US-China as persistent overhangs; least likely to resolve favorably for sentiment.</li>
<li>Government shutdown state/local real estate (REITs) and defense stocks most exposed if DHS/ICE gridlock is not resolved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>IPO Calendar:</strong>
<ul>
<li>2026–27 setting up for SpaceX, Anduril, Discord, OpenAI, Stripe, and several crypto/AI names. High valuation risk—liquidity premium may fade if index volatility surges or rates stay sticky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Income</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasury Yields:</strong> 10Y trading ~4.25%, 2Y at 3.57%. Bond market is now in 'wait' mode for inflation reports and any real fiscal event.</li>
<li><strong>Spread compression:</strong> Notable re-steepening; view risk as late-cycle, not recession-confirmed.</li>
<li><strong>Watch TIPS and long-duration bonds:</strong> Still pricing in sticky inflation and deficit expansion. Risk skew is toward higher volatility surrounding shutdown/debt ceiling headlines in March–April window.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities and FX</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil:</strong> Latest WTI moves ($61–65) highlight volatility around military actions and Middle East uncertainty. OPEC+ holds near-term stability, but Iran/Iraq/Yemen escalation could spike prices.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Silver:</strong> Recent news (uncertainty, US policy risk) is bullish; gold targets $5000–$6000 by June possible if inflation and/or geopolitical escalation accelerate.</li>
<li><strong>Grains/softs:</strong> Sudan famine/instability highlights pockets of supply risk not in market models; agricultural supply chains remain under-analyzed tail risk.</li>
<li><strong>USD:</strong> Remains strong but with slight roll-off (TWI ~117–119); stretches in USD bullishness are at risk if shutdown or Fed cut timing shifts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto / Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC and ETH:</strong> Both tracking the range; no imminent breakout given ETF and macro flows are neutral-to-negative. Volatility risk high in the event of regulatory or ETF news shock.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto IPO pipeline:</strong> Strong (Kraken, OpenSea, Consensys, possible MetaMask), but secondary valuations are vulnerable to a more hawkish Fed, new SEC enforcement, or a US regulatory incident.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoin risk:</strong> Key technical risks around new 'depeg' events; risk elevated if volatility spikes on macro events.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Event-Driven</h2>
<h3>AI/Tech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Big Tech rotation is ongoing; AI platform/infra leadership shifting to Google (Gemini), while regulatory/legal issues for OpenAI and Meta are potential volatility triggers.</li>
<li>Hardware edge (NVDA, TSMC) underpins AI premium even as software margins face pressure from litigation and structural price competition.</li>
<li>US government backstopping or regulating major AI infra (&quot;national security stake&quot;) is not a tail risk—this is moving toward consensus for certain companies (Anduril, PLTR, LMT, NVDA, OpenAI/Anthropic).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense/Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-front risk: Middle East (Israel–Iran, Yemen, Gaza), South China Sea, Ukraine. Little prospect of near-term de-escalation; cycle supports higher defense, security, oil, and gold exposures.</li>
<li>US DoD/ICE funding risk could trigger significant, real operational impacts for defense contractors and ripple into municipal debt/real estate (especially regions tied to federal budgets).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy Transition &amp; Climate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canada and US policy moves signal EV industry at risk from trade/tariff uncertainty; North American automaker supply chains (batteries, minerals) face higher volatility.</li>
<li>Extreme events (famine in Sudan, &quot;doomsday glacier&quot; updates, catastrophic risk discussion) raise profile for insurance, reinsurance, and commodity supply chains not fully reflected in valuation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Legal &amp; Regulatory Watch</h3>
<ul>
<li>Uber sexual assault verdict opens mass-claim risk for gig/consumer tech platforms; class action and insurance pricing will flow to equities and yield spreads.</li>
<li>DOJ/Trump/Powell crossfire shows real (even if less likely) risk of policy or personnel shock that could spike volatility in rates and across financials.</li>
<li>Potential shutdown, Supreme Court opinions, and Fed nominee debates are entering active risk window.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Near-Term Tactical Positioning / Focus</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be risk-off on tech/AI in the short term:</strong> Valuation and regulatory headwinds, plus index-level volatility, argue for defensives and alternatives over further FOMO.</li>
<li><strong>Look for defensive opportunity in real assets and hard commodities:</strong> Persistent geopolitical tail risks are structural, not just noise.</li>
<li><strong>Monitor upcoming jobs/unemployment and inflation prints:</strong> Confirmation of soft landing or any cracks will set Q1 direction for both equities and bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Eyes on shutdown/tariffs:</strong> Any extension or escalation immediately impacts rates, credit, defense, industrial, and consumer sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Watch IPO execution:</strong> Many high-profile unicorns in pipeline, but backdrop is fragile.</li>
<li><strong>Use options or volatility hedges, as near-term event risk is bifocal (US-Pres/Fed/policy, global flashpoints).</strong></li>
</ul>
