    <h1>Daily Memo (19-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Briefs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> Tensions with Iran are escalating; the White House is discussing timeline options for strikes, and the US has seized another Iran-linked oil tanker.</li>
<li><strong>Policy:</strong> The Trump administration is expanding ICE authority to detain legal refugees; separately, the EPA is repealing rules supporting climate protections.</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> JPMorgan is reportedly in talks to bank Trump’s &quot;Board of Peace&quot; for Gaza.</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A:</strong> Warner Bros. Discovery has reopened merger talks with Paramount after Netflix granted a waiver.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> Trump family hosting a crypto forum at Mar-a-Lago with Wall Street CEOs, signaling continued administrative support.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Macro Outlook: The &quot;Steady for Longer&quot; Pivot</h3>
<p><strong>Interest Rates &amp; Inflation:</strong>
Market consensus has decisively shifted away from a March rate cut (&lt;10% probability). The base case is now a <strong>June cut (~75% probability)</strong>. With the 10-year Treasury yield stabilizing around 4.05% and unemployment steady at 4.3%, the Fed is afforded patience. Inflation expectations for February and March remain sticky (2.3%-2.5% annualized), reinforcing the &quot;higher for longer&quot; bond thesis.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Avoid aggressive duration extension ($ZROZ/TLT) until data softens; short-term bills remain attractive cash parks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fiscal Drag - DHS Shutdown:</strong>
There is a high probability (&gt;90%) of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shutdown starting March 1st, with markets pricing in a duration of at least 7 days.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Short-term volatility for government services contractors and defense firms with high DHS exposure. Historically, these are &quot;buy the news&quot; events once the shutdown actually begins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Geopolitical Risk: The Iran Premium</h3>
<p>The probability of a US or Israeli strike on Iran by mid-2026 has spiked to ~67%. While a full closure of the Strait of Hormuz remains a tail risk (~27%), the elevated tension requires portfolio hedging.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy ($XLE, $USO):</strong> Oil markets are underpricing the risk of physical supply disruption. WTI at ~$64 offers an asymmetric upside hedge against conflict escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Defense ($XAR):</strong> Continued kinetic activity in the Middle East and expanded ICE powers domestically provide a dual tailwind for defense and security contractors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Focus</h3>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; AI ($QQQ, $SMH)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA ($NVDA):</strong> Earnings are imminent. Markets are pricing in a &gt;90% chance of a beat. The focus is less on the beat and more on guidance regarding the H100 successor and sovereign AI demand.</li>
<li><strong>AI Hardware:</strong> Expectations are high for OpenAI to announce consumer hardware (potentially wearables) in 2026, which could trigger a new cycle for component suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>SpaceX:</strong> Valuation expectations for a potential IPO are skyrocketing, with markets pricing a cap &gt;$1T. This creates a halo effect for the broader aerospace sector.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crypto &amp; Digital Assets ($BTC, $ETH)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sentiment:</strong> The Mar-a-Lago crypto summit signals strong executive branch backing. Bitcoin holding the $60k-$70k range suggests consolidation before the next leg up.</li>
<li><strong>Altcoins:</strong> Markets indicate a high probability of an Ethereum ETF flow reversal to positive.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Media &amp; Entertainment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>M&amp;A Arb:</strong> The Warner Bros. / Paramount talks are back on. This sector is ripe for consolidation, but regulatory hurdles remain the primary risk to deal closure.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>February 20, 2026:</strong> NVIDIA ($NVDA) Quarterly Earnings Report (Market moving event for Semis/AI).</li>
<li><strong>February 28, 2026:</strong> Deadline for potential release of further Epstein files (Reputational risk for named CEOs/Politicians).</li>
<li><strong>March 1, 2026:</strong> US Government Funding Deadline (High risk of DHS partial shutdown).</li>
<li><strong>March 6, 2026:</strong> February Nonfarm Payrolls &amp; Unemployment Report (Key for June rate cut thesis).</li>
<li><strong>March 12, 2026:</strong> February CPI Inflation Report (Must show cooling to keep June cut on table).</li>
<li><strong>March 18, 2026:</strong> FOMC Rate Decision (Pause expected; focus on Dot Plot revisions).</li>
<li><strong>March 19, 2026:</strong> Bank of Japan Policy Meeting (Watch for yield curve control adjustments affecting global liquidity).</li>
<li><strong>April 2026:</strong> Expected launch window for next-gen AI models (GPT-5.3 / Gemini 3.5 rumors).</li>
