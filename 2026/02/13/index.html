    <h1>Daily Memo (13-Feb-2026)</h1>
<h3>Top News Headlines</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitics:</strong> US deploying second aircraft carrier to Middle East amid rising Iran tensions; EU leaders preparing economic countermeasures against pressure from Trump, Russia, and China.</li>
<li><strong>Trade &amp; Tech:</strong> US and Taiwan sign trade agreement capping tariffs at 15% to boost chip investment; Asian markets retreated overnight on renewed tech jitters.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic Policy:</strong> Trump administration faces allegations of &quot;spying&quot; on Congress; Trump deportation plans (250k-500k) viewed as highly probable (86%).</li>
<li><strong>Corporate:</strong> Citigroup raises CEO Jane Fraser’s pay to $42M; Amazon satellites successfully launched via Europe's Ariane 6 rocket.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Macro Thesis: The &quot;Wait-and-See&quot; Regime</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong> Markets have effectively priced out a March rate cut (~8.5% probability), shifting expectations to a <strong>June cut (~75% probability)</strong>. With the 10Y yield hovering around 4.18% and unemployment steady at 4.3% (FRED), the &quot;higher for longer&quot; narrative is entrenched for H1 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Certainty:</strong> Prediction markets now assign a <strong>94% probability to Kevin Warsh</strong> as the next Fed Chair nominee. This signals a return to orthodox, likely hawkish monetary policy, reducing uncertainty premiums but potentially capping equity valuation expansion in the short term.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation Outlook:</strong> Today's CPI print (Jan data) is expected to show annual inflation $\le 2.8%$ with high confidence. A surprise upside here would severely punish duration assets ($TLT, $ZROZ).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sector Watch</h3>
<p><strong>Semiconductors &amp; Tech ($SMH, $XLK)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bullish Catalyst:</strong> The US-Taiwan trade agreement is a major de-risking event for the semi supply chain, directly benefiting <strong>TSMC</strong> and US-based fabless designers.</li>
<li><strong>Earnings:</strong> Despite broader tech jitters, markets assign a <strong>92% probability</strong> that <strong>Nvidia ($NVDA)</strong> beats upcoming quarterly earnings. The AI hardware trade remains crowded but fundamentally supported.</li>
<li><strong>AI Models:</strong> Watch for the imminent release of <strong>Grok 4.20</strong> (high probability by end of Feb), which could act as a catalyst for volatility in AI-adjacent names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Defense &amp; Geopolitics ($XAR, $ITA)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Risk:</strong> While prediction markets are complacent on an <em>immediate</em> strike on Iran in Feb (~11%), the deployment of a second carrier suggests kinetic risk is mispriced. Probability of a US/Israel strike rises to ~60% by year-end.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine:</strong> Markets are pricing in a Russian capture of Pokrovsk by March 31 (~70%). Continued Russian advances may force increased EU defense spending, benefiting European defense contractors and US exporters.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Energy ($XLE, $USO)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asymmetric Risk:</strong> Oil markets are bearish (WTI ~$64) with prediction markets leaning toward prices staying under $70/bbl in Feb. However, the disconnect between low spot prices and high geopolitical tension (Carrier deployment) offers a cheap hedge via call options on energy volatility.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Healthcare ($XLV)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outbreak Trade:</strong> Measles outbreaks are expanding, with markets pricing a near-certainty of &gt;1,000 cases in the US. This focuses attention on vaccine manufacturers (<strong>Merck</strong>, <strong>GSK</strong>) and testing diagnostics (<strong>Labcorp</strong> - 84% beat probability).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Momentum has stalled. Markets indicate a higher probability of a dip to <strong>$60k</strong> before a move to $80k. The &quot;moonshot&quot; bias for $100k in Feb has evaporated.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Watch <strong>PayPal ($PYPL)</strong> and <strong>Robinhood ($HOOD)</strong> as stablecoin adoption grows; markets see high probability of stablecoin market cap expansion, benefiting payment rails.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Upcoming Catalysts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2026-02-13 (Today):</strong> US CPI Data release (Jan data) - <em>Critical for confirming the &quot;June Cut&quot; thesis.</em></li>
<li><strong>2026-02-20:</strong> Supreme Court ruling on Trump Tariffs (85% probability of ruling by this date) - <em>High impact for Industrials ($XLI) and Retail ($XRT).</em></li>
<li><strong>2026-02-27:</strong> US Q4 2025 GDP Second Estimate.</li>
<li><strong>2026-02-28:</strong> US Government Funding Deadline - <em>Partial shutdown risk (~22% probability of lasting &gt;5 days).</em></li>
<li><strong>2026-03-06:</strong> US Jobs Report (Feb data).</li>
<li><strong>2026-03-18:</strong> FOMC Meeting &amp; Press Conference.</li>
</ul>
