<hr />
<h2>Macro and Markets</h2>
<h3>U.S. Rates, Inflation &amp; Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FOMC is highly likely to hold rates steady at the next meeting.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Fed dissent votes expected; no clear path to imminent cuts. Market pricing (Fed Funds, Eurodollar implieds) shows slowing expectations for aggressive rate cuts in Q1–Q2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Yield curve (10y–2y) steepening trend, with the 2y at 3.6% and 10y at ~4.25%.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bear steepening typically signals either policy normalization or forward concern about inflationary pressures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financial conditions remain historically easy (CFNAI: -0.59), but unemployment is now above 4.4%.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Inflation: Core CPI trending slightly up, Core PCE flat to modestly higher.</strong>
<ul>
<li>FRED: Core CPI rose steadily throughout 2025, and latest market-implied data expects Jan/Feb CPI in the lower 3.0%–3.5% range.</li>
<li>Odds of &gt;3% CPI for 2026 have risen modestly, suggesting inflation sticky above Fed target, especially in services and utilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor market: Payrolls trend stable but softer; Unemployment hovering 4.4%–4.5% into Q4 2025.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Initial/continuing claims elevated but not spiking; JOLTS trending lower but not crashing—healthy slowdown, not full contraction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Short-end U.S. rates have mostly peaked; duration risk is asymmetric to the upside from here.</li>
<li>Credit—both high yield and HY-sensitive equities—face less risk from steep policy rate jumps, but profit warnings in Q1 remain possible.</li>
<li>Commodities: Weather-driven price spikes can lead to headline CPI upside surprises near-term.</li>
<li>Expect higher volatility for out-of-consensus CPI, NFP, or GDP prints over next month.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Global Macro: FX, Trade, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>USD: Broad trade-weighted index has stabilized near 120.</strong>
<ul>
<li>No clear directional push in spot FX, but above-average volatility possible with next U.S. funding/government shutdown deadline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commodity pricing:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Natural gas, heating oil, and some ag futures seeing substantial short-term spikes.</li>
<li>WTI crude remans in $56–61 range, less reactive to the storm, but subject to headline shocks if Mideast risk flares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy/geopolitical risk:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Russia/Ukraine strikes and “peace” talks stalemated—little hope for immediate de-escalation; physical risk premium in energy and ag (especially EU) markets persists.</li>
<li>No current signs Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, but probability is elevated for Q1–Q2 as the conflict web widens.</li>
<li>Multiple “flashpoint” probabilities are being repriced: U.S./Iran strikes, Israel-Lebanon escalation, and OPEC+ supply disruptions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Insurance, reinsurance, and energy transportation REITs face rising tail risks.</li>
<li>U.S. refiners/utilities may outperform if extreme weather causes broad regional outages.</li>
<li>Further supply shocks from Russia/Ukraine/Iran could create further upside for energy names and downside for Euro-block equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Political and Policy Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government shutdown risk remains, with variable market timing.</strong> Funding bill passage window runs into January 31.
<ul>
<li>Current odds tilt to a last-minute deal but high-frequency standoff can cause risk-off repricing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Impeachment, martial law, and Insurrection Act scenarios (low-medium probability, but priced-in volatility).</strong>
<ul>
<li>Significant political risk premium in market structure predictions (circuit-break trigger odds notably above historic average for a non-crisis year).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Election calendar mixes: U.S. midterms, French and Japanese snap elections each carry implications for FX and global cyclical equities.</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S.: High probability Democrats hold the House; Republicans likely to hold the Senate in 2026.</li>
<li>Policy narratives increasingly polarized between industrial policy/protectionism (tariffs, U.S. supply chain blockades) and “return to normalcy” narratives (trade, tech deals, defense/EU cooperation).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology, AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI adoption remains a multi-year driver, but hype outpaces realized revenue.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Google, Meta, OpenAI all in regulatory crosshairs; new antitrust/AI IP suits can catalyze headline volatility.</li>
<li>IPO pipeline is slow: Discord, Stripe, SpaceX best odds for eventual 2026/27 listings; multiples likely to compress as AI M&amp;A and SaaS fatigue persist.</li>
<li>Meta pausing teens’ AI access = increasing global regulatory pressure on platform youth safety (risk for engagement, ad growth).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI leadership: Google seen as odds-on favorite for #1 model this year, with Gemini 3/4 launches as near-term catalysts.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia widely expected to be largest company by market cap over next two months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech Q4 earnings (Apple, Meta, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia) will set tone for Q1.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Apple/Google: Ongoing supply chain moves (Apple/Intel) and regulatory friction (Google antitrust) threaten margin expansion in Q1 despite top-line growth.</li>
<li>Tesla: Expect significant guidance risk on deliveries, profit margins, and pricing due to new supply/demand and regulatory challenges.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Money Center banks under political pressure, with lawsuits and threatened regulation (see JPMorgan/Trump legal action).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fintech M&amp;A (e.g., Brex/Capital One) points to increasing consolidation—late-stage VC/fintech valuations likely to reset lower.</strong></li>
<li><strong>IPO windows for most high-beta fintech are effectively closed until volatility and funding stabilize.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Natural gas and power stocks may get windfall Q1 EPS/revenue from cold-weather price surges.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Integrated oil majors (XOM, CVX): Risk/reward still linked to headlines on Mideast escalation and OPEC+ production policy.</strong></li>
<li><strong>U.S. utilities: Weather tailwinds are positive but regulatory and storm risks rising.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Gold: Market is factoring in short-lived risk-off spikes rather than multi-month bull runs; any escalation in Mideast or U.S. political risk (shutdown, impeachment, headlines) could catalyze sharp rallies, but retrace quickly.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials &amp; Cyclicals</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retail sales and industrial production data confirm soft landing—slow but not recessionary.</strong>
<ul>
<li>Any surprises from winter storm effects not priced in; short-term winners = HVAC, home improvement, select retail (inventory needs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Housing: Home construction and Case-Shiller trends show stabilization, but higher rates and insurance costs (storm, premium hikes) cap recovery.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measles outbreaks could have an impact on insurance (short-term loss ratios up), vaccine providers (positive), and select hospital chains.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Healthcare remains one of few sectors where incremental regulatory noise (CDC panel controversy, polio/measles comments) could drive sharp factor rotation over next 1–2 weeks.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC and ETH expected to remain rangebound but with above-average volatility; directional view mostly a function of ETF flows, macro, and regulatory risk.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Stablecoin sector watching for de-peg or regulation headlines, with increased risk as election-year scrutiny grows.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fintech/crypto crossover (Stripe/Brex/Consensys IPOs): Windows remain mostly closed unless BTC re-tests highs or regulatory clarity improves.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Country/Regional Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>: ECB/BoE cautious, Eurozone GDP growth modestly positive but under downside risk (German recession odds high).</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>: Snap election likely; LDP majority base case, low CPI environment continues. Yen risk (JPY) tied to any policy pivot from BoJ.</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: Slow drip of stimulus, unpredictability in U.S. policy, and supply-chain onshoring create ongoing overhang for CNY, ADRs, and EM assets tied to China cycle.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>2026-01-28: FOMC rate decision/press conference</strong> — Sets tone for Q1 risk assets; no cut expected but any shift in dots/easing of language would sharply move rates/financials.</li>
<li><strong>2026-01-29: U.S. Q4 2025 GDP (advance estimate)</strong> — Key for cyclicals, risk appetite, Q1 earnings revisions.</li>
<li><strong>Late January: Big tech Q4 earnings (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, META)</strong> — Nasdaq and S&amp;P directionality into February.</li>
<li><strong>Early February: Major U.S. banks Q4 earnings (JPM, BAC, C, WFC, GS, MS)</strong> — Credit risk, loan growth, NII trends.</li>
<li><strong>2026-02-06: January U.S. employment/unemployment report</strong> — Tight labor market + weather impacts could swing policy/housing trades.</li>
<li><strong>2026-02-13: January U.S. CPI print</strong> — CPI surprise/overshoot relative to sticky services/energy inputs will be a risk-off catalyst.</li>
<li><strong>February: U.S. Treasury refunding announcement</strong> — Supply/duration pressure on longer-term bonds.</li>
<li><strong>February–March: U.S. government funding deadline risk</strong> — Potential shutdown could trigger short volatility, Treasuries rally.</li>
<li><strong>Early March: OPEC+ production policy meeting</strong> — New output quotas will determine upside/downside for oil, energy equities.</li>
<li><strong>Early March: ECB policy meeting</strong> — Any rate hike/cut adjustment affects EURUSD and global asset risk premia.</li>
<li><strong>Early February–March: ISM manufacturing/services data</strong> — Leading indicator for inventory stories and cyclical rotations.</li>
<li><strong>Q1 2026: Tesla earnings &amp; delivery guidance</strong> — EV sector sentiment setter.</li>
<li><strong>Now–June 2026: Key U.S. Supreme Court decisions</strong> — Tech, energy, healthcare, and labor/union-sensitive equities at policy risk for regulatory surprises.</li>
