    <h1>Daily Memo (15-Jan-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>News Summary (Key Bullets)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S.–Iran/Israel tensions:</strong> Trump reportedly favors swift, decisive U.S. military action if ordered against Iran. Security has been heightened at U.S. bases in the region and some troop adjustments announced.</li>
<li><strong>Federal Agent shooting in Minneapolis:</strong> ICE agent-involved shooting has triggered mass protests, with political fallout and elevated law enforcement presence.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Tech:</strong> X (Twitter) will curb Grok AI’s ability to generate explicit deepfakes after backlash. Massive demand for TSMC chips fueled record profits; AI chip/infra upcycle remains intact.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing:</strong> NTSB finds Boeing was aware of engine flaws in a UPS crash; this issue could have implications for regulatory scrutiny across the aviation supply chain.</li>
<li><strong>Major U.S. macro data:</strong> FOMC, CPI, jobs, and corporate earnings approaching; consensus is steady policy amid mixed labor and price data.</li>
<li><strong>Protests and national unrest:</strong> Several U.S. states (Minnesota especially) are experiencing significant protest activity, adding an air of domestic instability.</li>
<li><strong>Mideast geopolitics:</strong> Oil and defense exposures are increasingly sensitive to events or escalation in Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen.</li>
<li><strong>CES 2026:</strong> Consumer and AI hardware trends are focused on edge devices, pushing momentum in semiconductor, battery, and industrials.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro and Cross-Asset</h2>
<h3>U.S. Macro: Growth, Inflation &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic activity:</strong> Latest nonfarm payrolls remain basically flat. Unemployment edged higher but nowhere near cycle highs (December: ~4.4%). Job openings (JOLTS) still &gt;7M; labor market is gradually loosening.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Core CPI and Core PCE stabilized in Q4. Near-term CPI prints will anchor market expectations for the March FOMC meeting, but sticky components (e.g., shelter) still pose risk for upside surprises.</li>
<li><strong>Rates:</strong> Fed Funds at ~3.7%. Yield curve slightly less inverted (10Y–2Y spread +70bps), with 10Y around 4.18%. FOMC is widely expected to stay on hold at the January meeting, barring a shock.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Second-Order Risks/Opportunities</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rate sensitivity:</strong> High-rate environment is dampening housing (softening starts, decelerating Case-Shiller, though still positive YoY) and harder for SMID-cap credit.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal policy volatility:</strong> Elevated probability of U.S. government shutdown and likelihood of multiple veto/dissent scenarios. This increases the risk premium on U.S. Treasuries and high-beta cyclicals.</li>
<li><strong>US Credit Outlook:</strong> Substantial probability for a further U.S. credit rating downgrade in 2026 (market-implied), keeping medium-term pressure on long-dated Treasuries and dollar-funding costs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>China:</strong> Low probability of sudden leadership change or Taiwan escalation in the very near term, but ongoing military posturing and regulatory opacity present risk to supply chains/semiconductors.</li>
<li><strong>Europe:</strong> ECB expected to maintain rates for now; risk of negative growth in Germany and broader EU recession ahead. Any surprise ECB rate move would ripple globally via currency and European equity volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical:</strong> Mideast war premium to oil remains asymmetric—strike risk remains high for both the U.S. and Israel targeting Iranian assets over the coming weeks. Event risk (including major cyber/kinetic escalation) is not in market base cases, so outsized impact possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors and Themes</h2>
<h3>Technology, Semis, AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Chips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>TSMC’s record numbers confirm continued capex for AI, benefiting U.S. semis (Nvidia, AMD) and hyperscalers (GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, META).</li>
<li>Regulation risk is climbing with growing pressure around AI-generated content (Grok/X scandal), but direct revenue impacts for semis and cloud providers are not imminent. Watch for lawsuits/disruption at the Big Tech platforms.</li>
<li>Multiple major AI IPOs anticipated, but not immediately. AI infra cycle supports suppliers and select cloud/data center names, especially with latency-sensitive AI workloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech megacaps:</strong> Upcoming Q4 earnings are a catalyst. Outperformance now skews to companies tightly linked to AI, strong cloud, or hardware cycles (MSFT, NVDA, AAPL); litigation or antitrust remains a headline risk, but operational fundamentals are taking the lead this quarter.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Banks:</strong> Credit is stable but softer macro and possibility of credit-card cap legislation later in ‘26 is background noise. Regional/SMID banks face eroding NIM and credit quality as rates remain elevated.</li>
<li><strong>REITs/Mortgages:</strong> Ongoing rate pressure plus the prospect of Congressional scrutiny over institutional SFR (single-family rental) buying could create meaningful second-order headwinds, especially if regulatory reform/tax proposals develop momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/banks tie-in:</strong> Crypto ETFs and ongoing stablecoin adoption are drawing institutional flows, but regulatory actions in the next 3–6 months remain a tail risk, especially for platforms like Coinbase, Block, and PayPal.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy, Industrials, Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Oil prices are below recent highs ($59 WTI), but multiple geopolitical catalyst windows can reprice risk overnight (U.S./Israel/Iran risk clusters, OPEC+ meetings, shipping crowding in Red Sea).</li>
<li>European/Asian demand expectations could surprise either direction given weather, war, or economic turns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Industrials/Aerospace:</strong> Boeing under scrutiny after the UPS crash investigation; any penalty or additional regulatory bottleneck is more likely to hit supply chain and contractors, but unlikely to move broad indices in the absence of new incidents.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Copper, uranium, and rare earths could see volatility if any major disruptions result from Mideast or China supply chain strain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare, Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FDA/Drugs:</strong> Watch for diabetes cure or obesity/GLP-1 headline surprises; current probability of a new FDA approval is modest before 2027, but sector is sensitive to regulatory/lawsuit risk.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic/Public Health:</strong> Measles spike is not currently a macro driver, but risk of pandemic-like policies or insurance disruptions might rise if outbreaks accelerate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing, Real Estate</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage rates are persisting above 6%, curbing affordability and residential momentum. More pronounced softness in SF/NY/Austin and other high-flyers is apparent in price indices YTD.</li>
<li>“Ban on institutional SFR buying” proposals represent a meaningful tail risk for top public REITs and mortgage-exposed ETFs should they advance in Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto, Blockchain</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bid for BTC &amp; crypto:</strong> High implied probability of new S&amp;P 500 company BTC purchases and additional country-level adoption in 2026. Probability for new Ethereum token products and roll-ups is rising.</li>
<li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Chance for a significant (-10% to +15%) BTC/ETH daily move is high in 2026, partly driven by ETF flow cycles and regulatory headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical Hotspots</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran/Israel/U.S.:</strong> Probability rising for U.S. and/or Israeli strike on Iranian infrastructure (nuclear or oil) this month. Such an event would spike crude, defense, and gold exposures and pressure cyclicals, travel, and potentially emerging-market FX.</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine:</strong> No base-case move toward ceasefire or final border settlement by H1; risk of further territory changes and EU/NATO escalation remains a persistent overhang for defense and select European energy names.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific and Event Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSMC (Semis):</strong> Delivering blockbuster AI chip and system sales. This further strengthens supply chain demand for U.S.-listed semis and raises the floor for related AI SaaS/infra IPOs.</li>
<li><strong>Aerospace (Boeing, RTX):</strong> Boeing’s negative headlines and exposure to regulatory scrutiny continue to weigh on sector risk premiums. No immediate systemic threat, but any further aviation incident could trigger a major risk-off move in the industrials complex.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer tech (Apple, Amazon):</strong> Q4 tech results will determine near-term leadership. Pricing power (Apple; Amazon Prime, Spotify, Netflix) trends are broadly inflationary into H2 as companies push through more subscription and hardware price increases.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto equities (Coinbase, PayPal, Block):</strong> Headed into SEC, legislative, and potential IRS scrutiny windows. High volatility with potential for new capital inflows, but with top-down regulatory clampdown risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Tactical Watch List</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates:</strong> U.S. FOMC (Jan 29) – likely unchanged; forward guidance and dot plot in March remains key. Market pricing skewed toward cuts in H1 that may not materialize absent macro deterioration.</li>
<li><strong>Indexes:</strong> Equities trading at the top of their ranges. Macro stress (geopolitics, shutdown, or rate spike) could trigger sharp pullbacks; year-end index consensus is wide.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil poised for volatility (Gulf/Suez, Iran, or shipping disruption risk); gold maintaining momentum as risk hedge amid political and inflation uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Currencies:</strong> USD shows modest strengthening versus global risk and lagging EUR/JPY against rate differentials and softening EU/Asia data.</li>
<li><strong>AI regulation/IPOs:</strong> Legal and regulatory news (copyright, antitrust, AI safety law, or high-profile lawsuits) would have immediate alpha effects within tech and software leaders.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
