    <h1>Daily Memo (14-Jan-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Top News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>Major macro event risk: US and Israel airstrikes on Iranian sites, and possible Iranian retaliatory strikes, sharply escalating regional tensions, threatening oil supply routes and spiking energy prices.</li>
<li>Protests and unrest in Minneapolis stemming from ICE operations and controversial Trump administration immigration crackdowns, drawing national attention to policy/legal risks and local unrest.</li>
<li>Major US macro data indicates persistently tight labor markets, uptick in unemployment rate, and elevated core inflation. FRED data: December core CPI at 331.86 (up y/y), unemployment rate climbed to 4.4–4.5% (highest in 18 months).</li>
<li>Alphabet (Google) surpasses $4T market cap after inking an AI partnership with Apple, further consolidating big tech dominance. Tesla/Apple/Meta/Nvidia trading levels near recent highs, with positioning highly sensitive to macro and AI sector momentum.</li>
<li>Global AI race acceleration: US approves Nvidia’s advanced AI chip sales to China under new controls. Japan/South Korea strengthen diplomatic ties to counter China, with Japanese equities hitting fresh highs.</li>
<li>ACA open enrollment drops sharply as premium subsidies expire and coverage costs spike; this could be a drag on healthcare spending in 2026.</li>
<li>Multiple new SEC/DOJ enforcement actions in crypto and regional banks, increasing regulatory risk.</li>
<li>Severe global flu and measles waves ongoing; vaccine uptake stalls due to shifting CDC guidance, increasing tail health risks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economic Activity:</strong> FRED data signals cooling but not collapsing:
<ul>
<li>Payrolls: essentially flat vs. prior quarter, growth stalling below trend.</li>
<li>Unemployment Rate: up to 4.4–4.5% (late-2025)—first time at this level since pandemic reopening. Jobless claims shrinking modestly into year-end, but new upticks likely if macro shock occurs.</li>
<li>Core CPI: trending higher—December print above 330 for first time ever. PCE inflation also sticky (trend above 2%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policy &amp; Market Implications:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Near-zero probability the Fed hikes/lowers at Jan 29 FOMC; a high-confidence hold.</li>
<li>Rate futures &amp; market-implied forwards suggest yield curve remains modestly positively sloped (2s/10s at +0.65%), with pivot risk weighted toward easing later in 2026 as inflation remains above 3%, but little short-term policy relief.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal, Geopolitics, &amp; Shutdown Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li>Government shutdown probability by late January/early March is meaningfully elevated. This can trigger risk-off behavior and disrupt Treasury auctions, with spillover into liquidity and equity volatility.</li>
<li>Early signals on 2026 midterms suggest a Democratic House and Republican Senate scenario—legislative gridlock likely, with little pro-growth fiscal stimulus.</li>
<li>Energy, defense, and safe havens (USD, gold) at risk of volatility given Middle East and East Asian military tensions, especially if supply chains or shipping lanes are disrupted.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>Japan: Snap election talk is heating up. Political stability boosts Nikkei and JPY volatility, especially against USD carry trades.</li>
<li>Europe: GDP risk skewed negative for Germany/UK/Italy; at least one major EU debt downgrade likely in the next 18 months.</li>
<li>China: FX volatility risk remains with ongoing US/China chip and tech decoupling, despite recent Nvidia license extension.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Thematic &amp; Asset Class Signals</h2>
<h3>Rates, Bond Market &amp; Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>US Treasury curve remains slightly positive post-QE/QT normalization but is highly sensitive to growth and exogenous shocks.</li>
<li>Probability of aggressive 2026 bond rally is low without a dire recession or accident; modest, controlled easing is the base case.</li>
<li>Inflation is proving sticky—core CPI and PCE both above target, and market-based breakevens stay near 3%.</li>
<li>TIPS and gold see renewed demand on persistent inflation and hedging needs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy &amp; Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Oil: WTI stable in $55–60 range pre-attack, but Iranian conflict risk could drive rapid $15–25 spikes (near-term shock), especially if Hormuz is threatened.</li>
<li>Commodities (Ags, softs): Persistent Middle East instability would spill into shipping and supply chains, supporting grains and industrial metals.</li>
<li>Gold: Benefiting on risk-off spikes and central bank buying, especially with ongoing global uncertainty and looming US fiscal risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities (US &amp; Global)</h3>
<ul>
<li>US: S&amp;P expected to finish year positive barring “crash” catalyst. Tech/AI names trade rich—AI/semis (Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple) at peak multiples driven by reset global sector leadership.
<ul>
<li>Sensitivity is extreme: macro/GEO headline risk + consumer spending themes can drive meaningful short-term volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financials: Ongoing litigation (e.g. antitrust, crypto/SEC enforcement) and regional bank fragility persist; earnings call focus on delinquencies, buybacks, and cost-out.</li>
<li>Healthcare: CMS tightening and ACA cost increases could create selective headwinds for managed care, while flu/measles pandemic waves drive near-term volume surges for vaccines and testing.</li>
<li>Housing: Homebuilder and REIT earnings likely to emphasize cost inflation, stabilizing residential prices (Case-Shiller data slightly up), but higher mortgage rates limit volume upside in most metros.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives &amp; Digital Assets</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crypto: Ongoing BTC momentum, liquidity tied to ETF flows; halving event in play Q1–Q2 2026. Regulatory/judicial actions remain an overhang.
<ul>
<li>Risk-off rally in BTC and gold increasingly used as tail risk hedge on geopolitical shock.</li>
<li>Altcoins benefit from speculative capital, but outperformance tied to sustained ETF and institutional inflows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Real Assets: REIT volatility high, especially in office and retail segments. Home price index shows stabilization after declines, but elevated rates threaten refinancing and funding.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI &amp; Tech:</strong> Alphabet stands out as top AI/Cloud beneficiary, both from Apple deal and AI stack adoption tailwind. Nvidia continues to benefit from global chip tightness and AI GPU export policy wins (but at risk if China/US relations deteriorate).</li>
<li><strong>Autos &amp; Industrials:</strong> Tesla faces event risk (management focus, deliveries below 350k for Q1 likely). Expect volatility, especially if macro demand weakens. EV/robotaxi progress headline-driven not fundamental; supply chain risks re-escalate under geopolitical stress.</li>
<li><strong>Big Banks:</strong> JPM, BAC, GS all emphasizing delinquency, buybacks, and credit risk on earnings. Credit cards, margin compression, delinquency spikes are key focus areas for analysts amid consumption slowdown risk.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming/Media:</strong> Alphabet, Meta, Netflix will drive media M&amp;A/AI narrative. Netflix expected to reference price changes, competition, and potential Warner Bros/Paramount acquisition.</li>
<li><strong>Oil Majors/Services:</strong> US, European oil majors in focus given high tail risk on Iran/Middle East headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan 20:</strong> Bank of Japan monetary policy — JPY, ongoing Nikkei momentum, global FX implications.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 22:</strong> ECB monetary policy decision — EURUSD, global exporters.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 28:</strong> FOMC/US Fed rate decision — rates/yield curve, short-term equity and credit volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 29:</strong> Advance US Q4 GDP — sets Q1 growth/inflation narratives, cyclical vs. defensives.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 30:</strong> Dec 2025 PCE inflation (Fed preference) — critical for narrative on further easing, impacts long-duration tech.</li>
<li><strong>Early Feb:</strong> US ISM PMIs (Feb 3–5 est.) — sector/commodity cyclicals.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 6:</strong> January 2026 jobs report (NFP, unemployment) — near-term volatility inflection for consumer/retail/rates.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 13/18:</strong> Jan 2026 CPI and PPI inflation reports — key for bond/commodity volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Late Jan–mid Feb:</strong> US Q4 mega-cap tech earnings — sector rotation/growth trade, AI/Cloud/Mobile stack.</li>
<li><strong>Mid Feb:</strong> US Treasury quarterly refunding size/tenor — long-bond, ZROZ, curve positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Early March:</strong> US debt ceiling/funding deadline — risk-off event for Treasuries/equities, defense, contractors.</li>
<li><strong>Early March:</strong> OPEC+ production meeting — energy, oilfield, inflation trades.</li>
<li><strong>Throughout Q1–Q2:</strong> Supreme Court decision window (tech/antitrust/corporate) — big tech regulatory headlines and potential sector volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> Bitcoin halving/tail ETF/flow impact — risk sentiment, crypto miners, digital assets.</li>
<li><strong>Early–mid February:</strong> US REIT earnings/guidance — rates, MBS, property valuations.</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly:</strong> S&amp;P/MSC quarterly index rebalances — sector ETF and single-stock flows.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Michigan inflation expectations — TIPS/gold/thesis for CPI/PCE.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Multiple overlapping global risks (Gulf/Middle East, China/FX, AI race, pandemic spikes, fiscal/political gridlock) mean risk premium in safe havens and commodities should stay elevated, while crowded consensus tech/AI longs are vulnerable to sharp tactical reversals on any macro/geopolitical discontinuity.</p>
