<h2>Macroeconomic &amp; Policy Outlook</h2>
<h3>Economic Growth &amp; Labor</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>GDP/Employment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recent FRED data shows slow but stable payroll growth into late 2025 and unemployment stabilizing 4.4%–4.5%.</li>
<li>Recession starting in 2026 remains a minority scenario, with markets pricing in continued 2–3% GDP for 2026.</li>
<li>Leading indicators (consumer sentiment, job openings) show softening but no immediate collapse.</li>
<li>Wage growth expected to remain modestly above inflation for 2026, supporting consumption and retail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Yield Curve &amp; Rates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>10Y/2Y spread positive again (curve has un-inverted). Futures/markets price little near-term cut risk; FOMC expected to &quot;pause&quot; at next meeting.</li>
<li>10Y yield ~4.2–4.3% reflecting policy pause and diminished risk premium for now.</li>
<li>Futures imply only modest Fed cuts through 2026, with no major rate cut on the January agenda.</li>
<li>Market consensus is for rates to remain elevated well through H1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation Print</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core CPI and PCE readings trending up, but YoY momentum mild/non-accelerating. Real time data shows headline CPI tracking steady (core CPI through Dec +0.6% q/q).</li>
<li>Inflation swaps and prediction markets discount sharp moves in either direction through H1 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal/Political</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>High probability of a US government shutdown in coming weeks (probabilities &gt;75%) with spending bills gridlocked into February.</li>
<li>Funding standoffs are likely to be short-lived; markets have priced in disruptive events, but extended shutdown probabilities are diminishing.</li>
<li>New tariffs on South Korea add to a broader protectionist push—industrial/auto supply chains likely disrupted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>FX/Commodities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>USD index is retracing as investor anxiety spills into flight-to-safety flows (notably into gold, yen).</li>
<li>Oil stable in the $59–61bbl range despite Middle East tension; near-term volatility risk is to the upside if conflict in Iran/Israel escalates.</li>
<li>Gold resilience as a portfolio hedge persists, with spot price drifting higher on dollar weakness and rate expectations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Regional &amp; Geopolitical Themes</h2>
<h3>US</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>DC Shutdown/Policy Uncertainty</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Short-term positioning in Treasuries (including TIPS) and defense/contractors should account for rolling disruptions and the chance of temporary equity volatility.</li>
<li>Infrastructure and CHIPS-related disbursements could face Q1–Q2 delays; defensive sector posture prudent for contractors, cyclicals, and regional banks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>China</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>No abrupt leadership change or invasion of Taiwan is expected by mid-2026, but tensions remain acute.</li>
<li>China's Q1 growth projections rest in the 4.5–5% band, supporting modest commodities demand, but without fiscal bazooka or re-acceleration.</li>
<li>PBOC to hold rates; CNY will likely grind lower as capital flows out and the US trade stance hardens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Japan</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>BOJ likely to hike rates modestly in April, supporting the yen and FX hedged equity flows.</li>
<li>Japan’s political posture hardens on Taiwan, likely leading to increased US defense deployments and further yen strength.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Europe</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>UK/EUR</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Starmer's China engagement signals UK–US divergence on trade. EUR and GBP holding stable, but any escalation in EU tariffs could become sectoral and multi-country.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>MENA/Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Markets ascribe increased odds to US or Israel strike on Iran by Q2 2026; 1H strike risk seen as meaningful, oil price floor forming.</li>
<li>Shipping and oil equities face moderate upside on supply risk, especially on sustained risk premium if the Strait of Hormuz is closed.</li>
<li>Israel/Lebanon cross-border flare-ups will keep defense assets bid.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Asset Class Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Indices</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>S&amp;P 500 / Nasdaq</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets expect a positive year for both S&amp;P and Nasdaq but price in rising volatility around macro and political events.</li>
<li>Range-bound view persists: no new record highs priced through February, but correction risk is relatively low absent a major shock.</li>
<li>Short-term drawdown may occur if government shutdown protracts or Mideast hostilities escalate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Volatility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketwide circuit-breaker/prolonged dislocation risk remains low unless triggered by DC or major geopolitical surprise.</li>
<li>Tail hedges or volatility overlays should be maintained for portfolios with high beta/growth tilt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Income</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Treasuries</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yield curve normalization opens door for layered bond exposure, but with little duration upside unless recession risk rises.</li>
<li>Any fiscal crisis will be transitory; bias to buy duration above 4.3% yield on forced price dips.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TIPS/Inflation Protection</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market-implied break-evens show no immediate inflation scare.</li>
<li>Hold TIPS as an anti-shock risk hedge, especially given policy/fiscal uncertainty and labor tightness.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Energy</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oil is range-bound but a sharp risk premium is possible on Iran/MENA escalation.</li>
<li>Energy producers offer convexity to upside with little downside absent severe US/global demand hit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gold/Silver</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong demand for gold as alternative store of value; undercurrent of flows as USD retraces.</li>
<li>Silver tracking gold, with additional upside if industrial restocking cycle materializes H1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin, Ethereum, most major coins sideways with high realized volatility; not expected to lead portfolios for Q1 unless regulatory breakthroughs or aggressive inflows resume.</li>
<li>Multiple regulatory and ETF developments in play for H1—portfolio allocation should be nimble, not directional.</li>
<li>Markets do not expect any major coin to break all-time-highs this month.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thematics: AI, Tech, Earnings</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Mega-Cap Tech</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Q4 reporting season (AAPL/MSFT/META/NVDA) expected to show solid topline but margin pressure from wage, data center, and currency headwinds.</li>
<li>GenAI/AI competition is intensifying, with Google/Gemini models widely expected to lead benchmarks into mid-year.</li>
<li>Anticipate management to signal AI-related opex and capex acceleration.</li>
<li>Ongoing probes/antitrust and TikTok regulatory developments could disrupt the ad ecosystem in 2H 2026.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EVs/Autos</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla's Q4 delivery and production data, along with FSD/robotaxi updates, will be watched for volume acceleration signals; odds for regulatory talk (China tariffs, FSD, battery) are high on the call.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Healthcare</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drug approval pipeline, especially for obesity/diabetes, can drive large cap multiples. Fiscal risk persists for managed care/insurers with regulatory uncertainty into Q2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>

<li><strong>NVIDIA Q4 earnings</strong> (mid/late Feb): AI hardware sector tone-setter.</li>
