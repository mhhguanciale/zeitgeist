    <h1>Daily Memo (13-Jan-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Major Newsflow and Developments</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US–Iran Tensions</strong>: Trump administration weighing options for action against Iran amidst regime protests with signals of preparedness for large-scale conflict. Crowd violence at US Iran-protests signal potential for rapid escalation. Financial markets are pricing for the possibility of imminent US or Israeli strikes on Iran.</li>
<li><strong>Greenland/Arctic Geopolitics</strong>: Denmark and Greenland reaffirm US ties amid increased White House interest; international law emphasized by EU partners.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Actions</strong>: Major NYC nurses’ strike ongoing—suggests continued pressure on margins for hospital operators and managed care/insurer names.</li>
<li><strong>Immigration Policy</strong>: Pro-immigrant legislative pushes in the US Northeast; signals moderation risk for companies dependent on immigrant labor or exposed to healthcare/urban public sector.</li>

<li><strong>US Inflation/Disinflation</strong>: Debate intensifies on stickiness of inflation metrics and ability of the Fed to execute cuts. Data releases and Fed guidance in focus for asset prices.</li>
<li><strong>Trump Climate Policy</strong>: Wind/solar and “green” industry leaders warn of spillover/global repercussions from US green energy rollback under Trump. Offshore wind exposure is especially at risk.</li>
<li><strong>China/EU EV Trade</strong>: Potential deescalation as China and EU advance toward pricing and import quota guidelines for electric vehicles.</li>
<li><strong>AI/Optical Illusions/Benchmarks</strong>: AI systems now surpassing human performance on visual illusion tests—potential implications for big tech, LLM sector sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Google, NVDA, Tesla</strong>: Tech analyst upgrades/downgrades and “AI leader” narratives persist, likely shifting capital flows intra-sector.</li>

</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro and Asset Class Overview</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth &amp; Labor</strong>: FRED nonfarm payrolls and unemployment show stable but plateauing labor market (unemployment &gt;4.4%, limited new payroll growth in late 2025). JOLTS job openings are softening. Cyclicals vulnerable to slowdown signals.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation</strong>: CPI and core PCE indices remain sticky but not accelerating (flattening core trend ex-volatile categories). Odds slightly favor a Fed on pause to slow cut bias; no imminent upcycle but inflation is not decisively broken.</li>
<li><strong>Rates and Yield Curve</strong>: Fed funds ~3.7%; 10Y-2Y spread ~+65bp, 10Y-3M ~+52bp (FRED), neutral-to-slightly upward sloping. Market reflects balanced recession vs. reflation concerns for duration assets.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer/Sentiment</strong>: University of Michigan sentiment index decaying (latest 51.0, below historical norms); retail sales and industrial production drifting sideways with no strong acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>US Dollar &amp; Credit</strong>: Broad trade-weighted USD index edging up; financial conditions comfortably loose but uptrending USD alongside geopolitical premium.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds and Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>UST Curve</strong>: Expect further curve steepening near-term if geopolitical events/US-Iran drive risk-off. Credit spreads may widen quickly on any disruptive escalation.</li>
<li><strong>Treasuries</strong>: Moderate risk of “flight-to-quality” rally (especially long duration), but with lingering high deficit/issuance pressure.</li>
<li><strong>TIPS</strong>: Market not pricing inflation blowout at this time, but volatility in oil/energy increases convexity value.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil, Energy</strong>: Near-term escalation in the Persian Gulf (Strait of Hormuz, Iran/Israel/US) could trigger $5–10/bbl upside shock to WTI; longer-dated projects vulnerable to both price spikes and chronic supply risk. US/EU wind/solar industry faces rising regulatory and tariff overhang.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: Geopolitical premium lifting floor; bid for safe havens if Iran/US/Israel tit-for-tat escalates.</li>
<li><strong>Ags/Softs</strong>: No acute signals, but climate and labor instability could affect 2026 growing season.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC/ETH/SOL</strong>: High realized volatility. Next ~7 days see heavy focus on institutional ETF inflows, potential further government/sovereign buyers, and regulatory heats (stablecoins, credit access). US credit card clamp could impact on/off-ramps.</li>
<li><strong>Market Structure</strong>: SEC and ETF catalyst calendar on near-term regulatory risk. Speculative bid remains given regime risk and cross-border volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Macro Flows</strong>: Any risk-off move (Mideast war) will see BTC bid as &quot;hard asset&quot; rival to gold. Large corporate/sovereign purchases and S&amp;P index inclusions would be new positive triggers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic Highlights</h2>
<h3>Financials/Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit Card/Consumer Finance</strong>: Trump proposal for interest rate caps is a material headwind to card issuers’ revenue models (COF, DFS, AXP, major banks). Probable margin compression and shift to riskier lending/personal loan products.</li>
<li><strong>Big Banks</strong>: Own-earnings tension between credit normalization and NIM pressures. Consumer banking especially at risk if labor market weakens further.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech/AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI Pacesetters</strong>: Google, Meta, Nvidia positioned for AI model “leader” headlines into earnings; hardware/LLM spending remains unchallenged. Regulatory risk rising domestically and abroad.</li>
<li><strong>Social/Ad Tech</strong>: Global minors/under-16 bans (Meta) could foreshadow similar policy momentum in the US/EU; attach risk for growth in social user KPIs.</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A/IPO</strong>: Transaction window faces regulatory, valuation, and macro headwinds, especially for AI/crypto unicorns (OpenAI, Anthropic, Discord, Kraken).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Industrial</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil Majors</strong>: Venezuela-related policy swings continue. US shale/majors are “optionality” plays in event of disruptions; slow output ramp in Venezuela and OPEC+ discipline plausible.</li>
<li><strong>Wind/ESG</strong>: Trump green rollback risk is top of mind; global spillover into supply contracts, equipment order books.</li>
<li><strong>Autos/EVs</strong>: China/EU truce on EVs reduces tail risk for near-term negative headlines in lithium/battery supply chain and European OEMs.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managed Care</strong>: NYC nurses’ strike signals continued upward labor cost pressures; bad for hospitals and select insurers exposed to unionized markets.</li>
<li><strong>Obesity/Metabolic</strong>: Retatrutide FDA approval odds unchanged; slow progress but high embedded expectation in pharma multiples.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Estate/Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Housing Data</strong>: Residential pricing is stabilizing (Case-Shiller), but higher mortgage rates and cooling starts will keep homebuilders/realtors “range-bound.” Trump proposal to ban institutional SFR could further disrupt REIT/PE exposures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Geopolitics &amp; Second-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iran/US/Israel</strong>: Any kinetic escalation or regime collapse in Iran would disrupt oil supply chains, spike energy/freight costs, and likely lead to a broad risk-off in equities/EM FX. Gold, US Treasuries, and defensive sectors benefit disproportionately from further risk.</li>
<li><strong>China, EVs, Trade</strong>: De-escalation with the EU on EVs reduces “extremes” risk, but ongoing competition in AI/semis remains. Key to watch for tech/semicap equipment and large-cap AI stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic US Policy</strong>: Trump’s directional policy on regulation (financials, green energy, labor) and cabinet instability could increase volatility across large-cap sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Credit &amp; Macro Regimes</strong>: Any surprise in coming inflation data, jobs, or GDP revisions may further shift Fed cut expectations and feed rapid repricing across equities, rates, and FX.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company Flags</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Credit Card Lenders (COF, DFS, major bank cards)</strong>: Negatives on headline and actual rate cap policy risk.</li>
<li><strong>Big Tech (NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL, META, TSLA, AMZN)</strong>: Leadership headlines, earnings, and AI/IPO/consumer cycle catalysts set to drive intra-complex rotations.</li>
<li><strong>Major Oil (XOM, CVX, European majors)</strong>: Venezuela, Iran, and OPEC+ headlines are directionally supportive; supply/demand imbalances remain fluid.</li>
<li><strong>Mega Cap IPO Pipeline (Discord, OpenAI, Anthropic, Kraken, SpaceX, Databricks)</strong>: Windows for late-2026 possible, but resistance high on valuation and regulatory overhangs; less likely window Q1–Q2.</li>
<li><strong>Hospital/HC Service Providers</strong>: Wage cost and labor relations risk worsened.</li>
<li><strong>Wind/Solar Leasing and Capital Equipment</strong>: At risk if Trump signals hard rollback and global policy contagion resumes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<li><strong>Monthly (6-month focus)</strong>: US housing data (home sales, Case-Shiller, starts) – signals for MBS, REITs, homebuilders.</li>
<li><strong>Quarterly (next year)</strong>: Treasury refundings/issuance – risk for duration, long bonds.</li>
<li><strong>Ad hoc, 12 months</strong>: High-profile AI/EV/semiconductor investor days and demos – can reset SOTP/sector momentum.</li>
<li><strong>12 months</strong>: Global climate/energy policy summits with near-term implementation – capex and capital flow risk for carbon-intensive and utility sectors.</li>
