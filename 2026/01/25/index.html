    <h1>Daily Memo (25-Jan-2026)</h1>
<h2>Notable Newsflow</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Winter Storm</strong>: Severe ice and snow across the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and parts of Texas causing broad transport/logistics disruption, flight cancellations, and risk of extended power outages (see News: CBS, NBC, ABC, USA Today, Governor NY, etc.).</li>
<li><strong>Labor &amp; ICE Protests</strong>: Large anti-ICE rallies and business closures in Minnesota amid reported ICE-involved fatal shootings (Reuters, NYT, NBC).</li>
<li><strong>Russia-Ukraine</strong>: Reports of &quot;positive&quot; U.S./NATO-Ukraine-Russia talks, but no meaningful breakthrough; Donbas/Donetsk fighting ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy</strong>: Broad FOMC expectation for steady policy next week; key focus shifting to March, dot plot, and succession chatter (Investopedia, Reuters, ING).</li>
<li><strong>Yen Volatility</strong>: BOJ and Japan PM signal readiness for action on sharp JPY moves after spikes; increased FX risk management discussion.</li>
<li><strong>US/EU Tariffs/Greenland</strong>: More EU leaders and White House maneuvering on tariffs, U.S. military basing, and Greenland, but latest reports indicate some tactical retreat by the administration (Fortune, CNN).</li>
<li><strong>Earnings Season</strong>: Major U.S. banks, big tech, and some consumer/auto names reporting; early commentary broadly constructive, retail/pre-announcement risks rising.</li>
<li><strong>Severe power outage warnings</strong>: East Coast/Western utilities bracing for potential multi-day grid stress/outages post-storm (WaPo, FirstEnergy, WHSV).</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Watch</strong>: Iranian regime stability under scrutiny as protests and incidents escalate—ISW tracking new regime/military violence, and outsized U.S./Israel strike risk remains highlighted in markets.</li>
<li><strong>Texas Politics</strong>: Democratic Senate primary debate signals progressive positioning and calls for major immigration/ICE policy changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Cross-Asset</h2>
<h3>Growth &amp; Recession Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US GDP tracking strong for Q4 ‘25 and Q1 ‘26</strong> (high probability &gt;2.5%), supported by still-firm nonfarm payrolls momentum (FRED: Dec NFP and low layoffs), but elevated unemployment readings (FRED: Dec/Jan at 4.4–4.5%).</li>
<li><strong>Yield curve (10s-2s at ~+65bp)</strong>: De-inverting, but not yet signaling classic cycle turn; spreads no longer screaming imminent recession, but term premiums up.</li>
<li><strong>Recession odds through H1 ‘26 moderate; negative growth probability discounted in markets remains low (&lt;15% for actual negative GDP print in ’26).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Consumer spending</strong>: Still firm per latest retail sales data, but softening consumer sentiment (UMich D: 52.9 through Dec) could cap upside for cyclicals going into fiscal uncertainty.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Headline/core CPI and PCE</strong>: FRED shows steady/gradual disinflation, but prediction markets see non-trivial risk of CPI &gt;3% in 2026 and a ~1-in-4 chance inflation surprises &gt;3.5%. Scenario risk for rates/bonds remains if inflationary surprises emerge after this energy/transport shock.</li>
<li><strong>Fed policy</strong>: Markets see next FOMC as a clear “no action” with multiple dissents possible. Probability of a March cut is priced below 25%, but risk builds into H2 ‘26 for 1–2 cuts if growth/inflation moderate further.</li>
<li><strong>2Y/10Y yields</strong>: FRED shows 2Y at 3.6% and 10Y at 4.25%—stable, underscoring reduced near-term volatility, but vulnerability remains if either inflation data or shutdown outcomes surprise.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal Policy &amp; Shutdowns</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Government funding</strong>: High risk of at least a short shutdown into Feb/March—prediction markets now assign ~75%+ odds of funding lapse past 1/31.
<ul>
<li>Second- and third-order: Short shutdown likely manageable for markets, but extended impasse would pressure Treasuries, risk-selling in cyclicals (defense/contractors, REITs, infrastructure), and could further delay dataflow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Debt/Deficit</strong>: Markets expect US debt to hit new highs (&gt;40T by ’27), putting premium on TIPS/long-duration Treasuries, especially if risk-off or policy stress emerges.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic</h2>
<h3>Commodities/Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crude oil</strong>: Spot WTI around $59–$61, with markets pricing two-directional risk—winter storms bullish near-term, but softening economic data and non-zero ceasefire/progress in Russia-Ukraine slightly dampening longer-term threat.</li>
<li><strong>Prediction markets</strong>: Wide skew on Middle East; risk of oil &gt;$90 by year-end tied to Iran/Israel/US clash, but base case for first half is stuck near current range unless direct hostilities break out.</li>
<li><strong>Utilities/REITs</strong>: Storm risk/high outage probability is acute for East Coast and TX/OK/MA utilities; could hit Q1 earnings (insurance claims, outages) and generate higher spot power prices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology, Banks &amp; Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Big Tech</strong>: Minimal near-term idiosyncratic macro; earnings reports over the next two weeks critical for index direction ($QQQ, $SPY).
<ul>
<li>AI regulation and leadership change chatter (OpenAI, Apple, Google) continue as overhangs—low-probability “shock” but discounts are being taken in manager surveys.</li>
<li>FTC/antitrust action vs. major platforms continue on slow boil (Amazon, Meta, Google as most at risk).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Banks/Financials</strong>: Early results better than feared, but FRED jobless claims ticking higher and shutdown threat create “late cycle” undertones for loan growth, credit spreads, and REIT/CRE exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/Exchanges</strong>: No signs of mainstream institutional failure (e.g., JPM, Citi), but IPO watchlist for crypto/broker names remains active; risk pivots with BTC flow and ETF demand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Industrials, Autos, Discretionaries</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transportation</strong>: Airlines and logistics could see multi-day earnings hits from winter storm; significant storm/ice and outage-related flight cancelations up and down East Coast and TX. Expect delta in Q1 guide-downs/statistical disclosures.</li>
<li><strong>EVs/Autos</strong>: No sign of dramatic US slowdown, but high-freq data show mounting pressure on manufacturing/housing activity; any EV subsidy/tax credit change with the coming FY2027 budget or trade talks could incrementally move sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>Housing</strong>: Case-Shiller indexes flat-lining, new supply remains soft; 30yr mortgage rates stable above 4.5% with some downside risk if employment or supply deteriorates post-shutdown/freeze.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense plays at premium</strong>: Israel/Mideast strike risk remains a market focus; odds of US or Israeli kinetic action against Iran or proxies high enough to move oil/defense names if headline risk picks up.</li>
<li><strong>Asia risk</strong>: BOJ/Japan snap election could fuel more JPY volatility—little implication for equities unless sharp disorderly currency moves force policy or capital flow intervention, which is only starting to show up at the political level.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single Stocks, IPOs &amp; Event Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>IPO/Unicorn pipeline</strong>: Discord, Kraken, SpaceX most likely to print public market deals in 2026; Stripe, Brex, OpenAI (less likely) could surprise but still battling soft backdrop. Valuations for hyped AI/crypto names appear at risk of reset if Q1/Q2 volatility spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Management succession chatter</strong>: Focus on Apple, JPMorgan, OpenAI (particularly with policy/FTC/AI regulation in the air).</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Execution in EV/energy fine, but severe winter weather and elevated power demand could stress supply chain/logistics for Q1 reported numbers.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Crypto</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTC/ETH/SOL/XRP</strong>: Short-term up/down extremely choppy; ETF inflow momentum cooling but &quot;big dip&quot; buyers still present. Consensus that any material regulation/fiscal embargo event (including government shutdown duration or financial crisis) will cause cryptos to trade as high-vol beta to risk assets in near term.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of &quot;January effect&quot; in major tokens minimal; potential for sharp downside in MSTR/COIN if flows reverse and retail sentiment sours post-ETF excitement.</strong></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Second/Third-Order Watchpoints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extended government shutdown</strong> = risk of missed payroll for federal/contractor employees, ripple to consumption/cash flow for small caps.</li>
<li><strong>Severe/lengthy grid outage post-storm</strong> = negative for regional banks, REITs, utilities but may create idiosyncratic volume opportunity for defensive/retail/repair/DIY-related names.</li>
<li>**If geopolitical event (Iran/Mideast kinetic action) occurs, expect fast bid for Treasuries, energy rip, defense sector jump, and risk-off in cyclicals, especially airlines, cruise, and leveraged small cap.</li>
<li><strong>Fed leadership/confirmation</strong>: If Powell unexpectedly ousted or new, hawkish chair nominated, abrupt pricing-in of higher rates bias.</li>
<li><strong>If BOJ/JPY volatility persists</strong>: risk for Asian exporters, global multi-nationals translating yen profits, may also ricochet into risk-parity/quant portfolios.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>FOMC decision / Powell presser</strong> (Jan 28–29): Confirm “hold” and flag dissent, likely market volatility event for rates/financials.</li>
<li><strong>Major U.S. Tech earnings</strong> (Late Jan–Feb): Potential single-name/sector volatility.</li>
<li><strong>January Nonfarm Payrolls</strong> (Feb 6): Labor and rate cycle inputs, critical for cyclicals and financials.</li>
<li><strong>January CPI Inflation Report</strong> (Feb 13): Key input for bond/tech/consumer positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Treasury Refund Announcement</strong> (Early Feb): Duration and supply concern, could move long end of UST curve.</li>
<li><strong>Next U.S. government funding/shutdown deadline</strong> (Early March): If no bill, risk-off/defensive shift likely if protracted.</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia/AI/semis earnings</strong> (Feb–March): Material for AI sentiment, megacap tech.</li>
<li><strong>OPEC+ policy meeting</strong> (Early March): Oil/energy price and cyclical sector impact.</li>
<li><strong>Supreme Court tech/antitrust rulings</strong> (April–June): Potential major impact on tech structure and select single-names.</li>
<li><strong>US Q4 GDP second estimate</strong> (Feb 27) and Q1 advance (Apr 29): Macro direction, especially for cyclical/FX/utilities positioning.</li>
<li><strong>Key housing/reit data drops</strong> (late Feb): Housing-linked equities watch.</li>
<li><strong>US/EU/China Trade Talks</strong> (TBD through 1H): Any tariff, tech export, or critical minerals action could move semis, autos, industrials.</li>
<li><strong>FY2027 U.S. Defense budget release and markups</strong> (March+): Defense/aerospace sector sentiment lever.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoin halving aftermath &amp; SEC hearings</strong> (spring/summer): Crypto ecosys, miner, ETF impact.</li>
