<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Cross-Asset</h2>
<h3>U.S. Growth, Inflation &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> No major shift in 2026 GDP expectations; consensus is for solid positive growth (2.5–3%+). Cyclical equities remain supported barring external shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong>
<ul>
<li>2025 finished with month-over-month deceleration in core PCE and CPI; actuals for December continue to show only mild price drift.</li>
<li>Pricing for 2026 shows moderate risk of headline CPI pushing above 3% (not runaway), but little conviction in inflation overshoot scenarios (&gt;5%).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Payrolls, unemployment, and jobless claims remain steady, though unemployment creeping up (last 4.4–4.5%). No sign of acute stress (or full employment).
<ul>
<li>Upcoming January jobs report (Feb 6) will help clarify any storm-related distortions versus trend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fed Policy:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No change expected at the Jan FOMC; risk of one or more dissents, hinting at division over timeline for cuts.</li>
<li>Markets expect the first rate cut to come in either April or June; spread between 2Y/10Y narrowing, yield curve still modestly inverted.</li>
<li>Treasury yields hovering near 4.3% (10Y); bond volatility low, financial conditions easy.</li>
<li>Any surprise from FOMC or string of inflation surprises could move duration &amp; risk assets sharply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>U.S. Credit, Debt, and Shutdowns</h3>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government shutdown risk into late January/early March remains high—funding still unresolved.
<ul>
<li>Second and third order: Treasury supply/demand dislocation, safe-haven-type flows to USD and gold, but also potential spillover to consumer/contractor spending, healthcare, defense.</li>
<li>Debt ceiling not an imminent issue (spring 2026), but downgrade risk remains present (~40% probability).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fiscal discipline not expected: little conviction in public spending cuts or reversals on Trump-era tax policies.</li>
<li>TIPS and gold have renewed buying as fiscal, dollar, and shutdown narratives resurface.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global/Currency: FX, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>FX:</strong> Yen rally on intervention threat; pressure on Nikkei, yields fall.
<ul>
<li>Weak USD narrative building (“debasement”) but not matched by dramatic capital flight; risk assets still in demand.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Gold and silver making new highs (gold &gt;$5,000); retail and institutional demand broadening amid policy/political risk.</li>
<li>Oil has been rangebound ($56–$62), with little conviction in either upside or downside tail. However, options for “closure” of Strait of Hormuz or U.S./Israel strikes on Iran are being increasingly priced (15–20% by Q2).</li>
<li>Iran selling more oil but earning less; tail risks now matter more for spreads/volatility than for base pricing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spot bitcoin ETFs generating solid flows; more volatility in near-dated options/derivatives.</li>
<li>Regulation remains an overhang, but no immediate “black swan” on legislation.</li>
<li>Short-term trading set-ups around key levels (BTC $80–$100K, ETH $3K+) matter, but fundamentals tilted marginally bullish as next halving approaches.</li>
<li>High correlation with risk-off, gold-surge days (second-order: bitcoin/gold pairs as a trade).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>U.S. Sectors &amp; Thematics</h2>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI/Big Tech earnings enter a critical catalyst window (MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN): Outlooks likely to drive further Nasdaq/S&amp;P directionality for 1H 2026.</li>
<li>NVDA continues to price in unconstrained demand from cloud/AI, but sector showing nuanced signals due to increased hardware and new international AI model competition.</li>
<li>Regulatory headlines (antitrust, copyright law, SCOTUS) will heat up in Q2. Collection of regulatory “overhangs” is growing, but no immediate risk to QQQ multiple.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Industrials/Defense</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> U.S.–Canada and U.S.–Mexico trade friction rising—autos and energy are critical channels. Tariffs on Canadian autos could have meaningful price effects for North American supply chains.
<ul>
<li>OPEC+ supply discipline intact at least through Q1, but Middle East military risk premium is climbing (&gt;50% probability of some direct strike by June).</li>
<li>Clean energy/wind/renewables headlines give a relative boost to European/UK infrastructure plays, but will not immediately reprice global energy ETFs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Defense:</strong> Geopolitical events (U.S. or Israel strike on Iran; further escalation in Gaza, Yemen, Syria) are being priced in partially via options premiums in defense sector stocks and oil-vol derivatives.
<ul>
<li>U.S. government shutdown or funding gridlock may impact near-term defense contract flow, but is likely backstopped by supplemental budgets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Major winter storm disrupts retail (foot traffic, supply chain), airlines, and some local energy utilities/REITs; insurance carriers to see a spike in claims.</li>
<li>Retail spending still robust into year-end per FRED, but upcoming data may reflect adverse weather impact.</li>
<li>Home prices and starts were rolling over in late 2025; storm plus high rates means housing markets will stay soft or weaken further in Q1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials/Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Trump’s lawsuit against JPMorgan is emblematic of the anti-financial-establishment undercurrent. It has no direct effect on core bank earnings near-term but raises medium-term risk of populist-driven regulatory policy.</li>
<li>Large-cap U.S. banks (e.g., JPM, GS) remain insulated by balance sheet resilience for now—no acute stress lows in FRED data or news.</li>
<li>Rate curve dynamics (modest steepening, curve remains inverted) point to Net-Interest-Income headwinds fading but not gone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare/Biotech</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measles and flu uptick noted, but not at levels to move managed care or drug stocks meaningfully yet.</li>
<li>No new pandemic, but “public health” as a macro risk theme still sticky in consumer/retail and travel.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitical &amp; Policy Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geopolitical flashpoints:</strong> Bets on direct U.S. or Israeli military action in Iran increase throughout spring, especially as tit-for-tat escalations remain high.
<ul>
<li>Even if not realized, just sustained tension intermittently re-prices oil, gold, defense names.</li>
<li>Ongoing Gaza/Lebanon/Syria operations mean energy, defense and select EM assets will be bid up into further headlines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Trade &amp; Tariffs:</strong> U.S.–Canada and U.S.–Mexico relations risk downward shift if threatened tariffs are enacted, affecting North American manufacturing, logistics, and potentially food/commodity pricing.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine peace deal/security agreement:</strong> Short term, reduces energy and YCG/Oil risk; longer-term, opportunity to re-risk in European assets if progress sustained.</li>
<li><strong>China/EU–India deals:</strong> Any signed auto/trade pacts add confusion to the competitive landscape; longer run could shift global autos, logistics, and EM asset allocations.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Prolonged winter storm=knock-on effects for supply chain, construction, regional REIT, and consumer cyclical earnings in Q1.</li>
<li>Widespread power outages in the South and possible ice storms northward may trigger spikes in regional natural gas, pipeline, utilities pricing—possibly reflected by next-week price prints.</li>
<li>If government shutdown persists past early February—expect volatility spikes, safe-haven pivots, delay in government contract awards, and interruptions in economic/labor data flow.</li>
<li>TIPS and gold will find major bid if shutdown + geopolitical shock coincide.</li>
<li>U.S. legislative gridlock/funding drama into March could, by second order, slow the pending U.S. Treasury issuance schedule, with possible near-term rally in long-dated bonds/TIPs.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Micro / Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li>NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA all entering key earnings/guidance window—market regime shifts and index flow can be dictated by any major miss or guide-down.</li>
<li>TSLA: Focus on U.S., Europe tariff risk, China narrative, and energy storage update; AI/robotaxi/hardware language in call will also matter.</li>
<li>JPM: High-level governance tensions/no immediate trading impact.</li>
<li>CDNs, data centers: Watch for weather-linked volatility plus ongoing AI infrastructure headlines.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan 28–29:</strong> FOMC interest-rate decision &amp; press conference — explicit guide for path/communication division; could spur curve repricing, Q1 tech move.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 31:</strong> December 2025 Core PCE inflation — impacts rate path, risk-on appetite, TIPS.</li>
<li><strong>Early Feb:</strong> Tech earnings (MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, AMZN, TSLA) — sets tone for mega-cap regime.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 6:</strong> January 2026 U.S. jobs report — crucial confirmation of macro trajectory post-holiday, post-storm.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 13:</strong> January 2026 CPI report — direct inflation read, market-moving.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 19:</strong> FOMC minutes (February meeting) — clues on policy split, dot plot nuance.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 14:</strong> Q4 2025 13F filings — possible signals of crowded trades, big portfolio shifts.</li>
<li><strong>Late Feb:</strong> NVDA earnings — key for AI sector, semis, cloud trade directionality.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 1:</strong> U.S. government funding deadline (pending budget deal) — potential for shutdown-driven volatility, contract delays.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11:</strong> February 2026 CPI — bond/risk reaction.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 12:</strong> ECB policy meeting — Eurozone rates/dollar impact.</li>
<li><strong>Mar (TBD):</strong> S&amp;P 500/QQQ quarterly rebalancing — index flows.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 17–18:</strong> March FOMC with dot plot — “first cut” window, macro directional risk.</li>
<li><strong>Ongoing:</strong> OPEC+ March ministerial, U.S.–China bilateral summits — impact on commodities, EM FX.</li>
