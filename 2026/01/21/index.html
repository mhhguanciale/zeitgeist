<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy, Inflation</strong>
<ul>
<li>FOMC is widely expected to hold in January amid sticky core inflation (December core CPI at 331.86, still trending 0.2-0.3% MoM in late-2025). Fed funds rate sits around 3.7%–3.9% (FRED).
<ul>
<li>Market is skeptical of immediate cuts; March is where odds for a cut jump meaningfully.</li>
<li>10Y yield trading in low 4s (~4.17 to 4.24%), 2s10s and 3m10s curves modestly positive but shallow, signaling “soft landing” narrative acceptance.</li>
<li>January CPI and PCE will help confirm or undermine the base case of inflation deceleration. If CPI &gt;3.2%, risk of hawkish rate repricing rises.</li>
<li>Near-term upside surprise on inflation (especially in services or energy) would drive a short, sharp USD and rates rally.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Labor &amp; Growth</strong>
<ul>
<li>Recent payrolls (December: 159,526k) and jobless claims (continuing claims ~1.88M) show continued tight but slightly softening labor market. Unemployment ticking up (4.3–4.5% by late 2025), suggesting risk of higher prints in 2026.
<ul>
<li>Probabilities tilt toward rising unemployment into 2026 (market consensus: 4–5% by midyear), but not a spike.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Core macro trend is moderate: Decelerating but still positive GDP growth; consumer sentiment remains weak (Nov at 51.0 per Michigan).</li>
<li>Broad risk: Recession in 2026 probability remains modest/sub-30%; government shutdown and debt ceiling are rising event risks as Q1 advances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Credit, Fiscal Policy, and Sovereign Risk</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>U.S. Sovereign Credit</strong>
<ul>
<li>Protectionist and fiscal event risk has increased due to Trump administration tariff expansion and the ongoing Greenland/EU standoff.
<ul>
<li>Another U.S. credit downgrade is plausible within 12–18 months on cumulative spending + tariff policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Government Shutdown/Spending</strong>
<ul>
<li>Budget fights and shutdown risk are rising into late Q1 2026. Current funding window tightens.
<ul>
<li>A shutdown or protracted standoff could drive risk-off (especially in small caps, cyclicals, and federal contractor space).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Global Sovereign Risk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eurozone: UK, German, and EU recession risk remains high; UK inflation data running hot; risk of Eurozone/UK growth surprise on the downside.</li>
<li>Argentina, Venezuela, Brazil: Ongoing political transitions and the risk of currency and sovereign instability could ripple through EM credit, LatAm oil/commodity equities.</li>
<li>BRICS expansion and bloc risk: 2026 is a critical inflection year; will affect global commodity pricing and FX stability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Commodities, Energy &amp; Shipping</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil</strong>
<ul>
<li>WTI trades $57–$59 but market expects extreme volatility risk tied to Persian Gulf military escalation (Iran/Strait of Hormuz event risk &gt;1H 2026).
<ul>
<li>Market increasingly prices 30–50% odds of a U.S. or Israeli strike on Iran in 2026, with a runup in Q1–Q2 as a critical window.
<ul>
<li>If closure or significant disruption of the Strait occurs, 25–40%+ oil shock is plausible; energy equities/inflation hedges favored.</li>
<li>Spillover: global shipping, insurance, and export-oriented EMs with oil leverage all acutely affected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>OPEC+ and Eurozone/EU Politics</strong>
<ul>
<li>OPEC+ meetings throughout H1, but policy path complex given U.S. protectionist stance.</li>
<li>Russia sees opportunity to exploit NATO division, slow grind in Ukraine for energy leverage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Logistics</strong>
<ul>
<li>Mediterranean/European rail &amp; port disruption (e.g., Spain train incident) adds to already-elevated shipping cost/port congestion risk.</li>
<li>ICE actions in New England may begin to affect agricultural/logistics labor supply regionally if prolonged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Equity Sectors and Styles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Markets</strong>
<ul>
<li>Large-cap U.S. indices benefitting from relative “resilience” and AI/tariff narrative, but tail risk from fiscal/sovereign event shocks is non-trivial.</li>
<li>Prediction bias apparent: Many macro markets overweight tail/extreme outcomes, but markets continue to “climb the wall of worry.”</li>
<li>Expected Q1–Q2 earning season: Tech/AI, financials, and consumer cyclicals are most pivotal in setting the risk tone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI, Semiconductors &amp; Tech Megacaps</strong>
<ul>
<li>NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, and GOOGL remain core leadership. Nvidia expected to be the world’s largest company by market value mid-year; semis and GPU infra demand holding up.
<ul>
<li>AI regulatory risk is a growing event (several AI-focused bills/laws possible in 2026).</li>
<li>Cloud and AI compute demand remains intense—hyperscaler capex, nuclear/special project data-center initiatives are plausible medium-term catalysts.</li>
<li>AI model innovation: Google and xAI seen as most likely to have top models by summer. Many “AI moonshot” outcomes are probably overhyped near-term, but high variance around OpenAI/Anthropic IPO windows.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Energy/Defense</strong>
<ul>
<li>U.S./European defense equities in focus given Middle East and NATO fracture risk.</li>
<li>Any oil supply shock (Iran) would drive defense and energy names sharply higher short-term.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>REITs &amp; Housing</strong>
<ul>
<li>Home price indices show near-flatline since Q2 2025, with risk for downside in coastal/urban names (NYC, LA).</li>
<li>Mortgage rates remain elevated (6–6.5% range), preventing a quick housing recovery. Policy change banning institutional SFH investment is a ~40% probability this year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Travel, Consumer, Autos</strong>
<ul>
<li>Airlines: Travel volumes at/near record levels, but higher fuel costs and extreme cold weather (impacting airports and logistics) could impact Q1 earnings.</li>
<li>Consumer sentiment remains tepid. Measles outbreak and possible new COVID variant both threaten services/discretionary sectors modestly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/Bitcoin</strong>
<ul>
<li>Market expects a volatile but positive path for BTC and ETH through Q1–Q2; ETF flows have been positive but are highly reactive to both U.S. and China policy headlines.
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin viewed as having ~80% probability of exceeding $80K again by mid-2026, but with recurring 10–15% drawdown events.</li>
<li>Increasing odds of U.S. sovereign/major S&amp;P 500 companies adding crypto to reserves; legislation on market structure possible by midyear.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Key Individual Names</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple (AAPL):</strong> Company transition in leadership underway over the mid-horizon; folding iPhone and Air/MacBook hardware launches expected this year. Upside swing potential if supply chain or AI rumor cycle surprises positive.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla (TSLA):</strong> Robotaxi (FSD) milestone risk, “Optimus” and battery/energy narrative remain prominent; China trade/competition, and global tariff risk are the major negatives.</li>
<li><strong>Meta, Google, and Microsoft:</strong> All face both upside from AI/Ad innovation and downside from antitrust/regulatory pressure (see FTC, EC risk, Apple app store, ad targeting litigation).</li>
<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Facing above-50% odds of antitrust liability before 2027.</li>
<li><strong>Defense (LMT, RTX, BA, Anduril):</strong> High sensitivity to Middle East escalation. Extreme tail event (Iran/Strait) would drive a multi-standard deviation upside for U.S. defense.</li>
<li><strong>Berkshire Hathaway/Kraft Heinz:</strong> Potential large portfolio realignments as Buffett’s successor telegraphing sale of big positions (KHZ).</li>
<li><strong>X (Twitter), Coinbase, PayPal:</strong> All face some risk from regulatory/market structure overhang; upside exists for continued U.S. acceptance of crypto payments and ETF volume.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second/Third Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Green tariffs and “capital wars” would drive:
<ul>
<li>Cross-border M&amp;A regime tightening, export bans, and global industrials divergence.</li>
<li>Devaluation pressure on “at-risk” EM/commodity currencies; possible impact on precious metals demand/supply shock risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Middle East escalation could drive a safe-haven bid/funding stress in the EUR, JPY, and CHF, plus tactical upside in gold and U.S. defense/infra names.</li>
<li>Fiscal dysfunction (debt ceiling, shutdown) increases “tail” volatility risk across rates, Treasuries, and interest-rate sensitive equities (mortgages, capex, utilities).</li>
<li>AI/tech upside is tempered by court/antitrust actions—reallocation within tech is more likely (Mega cap rotation, not broad risk-off).</li>
<li>Outbreak risk (measles/COVID): May impact travel, REITs (especially health, hotels), and insurance.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li>January FOMC meeting and rate decision: Confirms or shifts consensus on 2026 cuts/pause trajectory.</li>
<li>Late-January: Q4 2025 GDP advance, final Core PCE, January payrolls—cementing near-term direction for USD, rates, and cyclicals.</li>
<li>Early February: Treasury refunding announcement (supply risk, duration signals for rates complex).</li>
<li>Mid-February: Key CPI/PPI prints for inflation re-acceleration/disinflation confirmation.</li>
<li>Q1: Government funding/debt ceiling risk window (shutdown debate). Material for defense, contractors, USD.</li>
<li>Feb–Mar: ECB, BoJ meetings—watch for divergence risk vs. Fed regime.</li>
<li>Mid-March: FOMC &amp; Dot Plot—critical for duration and growth equities; March CPI/PCE.</li>
<li>Apr–May: Mega-cap Q1 earnings (tech, semis, banks).</li>
<li>Spring: U.S. housing data—Spring season will test for bottoming or further downside.</li>
<li>Mid-2026: OPEC+ production target meetings.</li>
<li>Rolling: Event risk around Greenland/NATO/EU trade ruptures, Iran/Strait of Hormuz, and major Supreme Court business/election decisions (May–June term end).</li>
