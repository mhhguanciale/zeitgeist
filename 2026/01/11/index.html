<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy Overview</h2>
<h3>Growth, Labor, and Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core <strong>CPI and PCE</strong> (Nov/Dec 2025 FRED data) show stickiness in the 3.2–3.4% YoY range—above target, but rolling over slightly from mid-2025 highs.</li>
<li><strong>Unemployment rate</strong> (Dec: 4.4%), up from early/mid-2025; <strong>nonfarm payrolls</strong> trend flat, job openings drifting lower—labor market showing some slackening.</li>
<li><strong>Continuing jobless claims</strong>: Rising since mid-2025, suggesting layoffs continue, consistent with softening labor demand in FRED and news coverage (tech layoffs).</li>
<li><strong>Yield curve</strong>: Still modestly upward sloping (10y–2y ~+70bps), market discounting multi-cut but orderly Fed path for 2026.</li>
<li><strong>Fed funds rate</strong>: Steady drift lower, just under 4% as of end-2025. Market and prediction pricing suggest further cuts, but not a rush to zero absent sharp downturn.</li>
<li>Short-term inflation prints (upcoming Jan 14 CPI, Jan 27–28 FOMC) are the major near-term macro inflections. No sign yet of a major inflation re-acceleration, but large oil/geopolitical moves could change that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Political Risk</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US debt ceiling/shutdown</strong>: New funding deadline now expected in February, elevated shutdown risk (~40% odds).</li>
<li><strong>FY27 budget</strong> process and Q4 GDP print will frame the 2026 political risk narrative, especially with midterms odds favoring Democrats retaking the House but Republicans likely Senate majority.</li>
<li>Ongoing <strong>Trump administration turnover, policy unpredictability</strong>, and new trade/energy saber-rattling (Iran/Syria/Venezuela risks) are creating volatility in rates/yields and select equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East</strong>: Rapid escalation—US and Israeli strikes in Syria; Iran regime instability; odds of US/Iran direct engagement or Israel-Iran strikes rising (30–50% range next 30–90 days). Oil/gold risk premium justified.
<ul>
<li>Any closure of the Strait of Hormuz or attack on Iranian oil infrastructure would have second-order effects for global energy inflation, insurance/cargo, and shipping equities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine</strong>: Ongoing risk of further territory capture by Russia; moderate odds of Black Sea shipping or infrastructure incident. Probability of ceasefire or peace deal by end-2026 has faded.</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>: Discussion around possible leadership transition has little near-term market impact, but Taiwan invasion/blockade odds have ticked up (13%+ by mid-2026). Semiconductor supply at risk; direct market volatility would be triggered if rhetoric escalates post-Lunar New Year.</li>
<li><strong>Emerging market (EM) credit</strong>: Venezuela prisoner releases and oil export negotiations signal new phase, but regime-change/US military involvement risk is low in the very near term; material only if energy markets tighten.</li>
<li><strong>EU/UK macro</strong>: Ongoing below-trend GDP prints in Germany; persistent high inflation and potential for a credit downgrade—drag on EUR and banks/industrial equities.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector and Asset Class Takeaways</h2>
<h3>Equities &amp; Market Structure</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Downside risk</strong> in Q1 has increased:
<ul>
<li>SPX downside hedges bid in options flows; probability of circuit-breaker events through 2026 is pricing ~20% range.</li>
<li>Prediction data point to low probability of negative growth or severe recession before mid-2026; downside risk is more about earnings degrowth in cyclicals/industrial and broad risk-off from exogenous shocks (geopolitics, shutdowns).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mega-cap tech</strong>: Q4 earnings season (late Jan–mid Feb) will likely set tone for AI-bubble questions and public/private sector multiples; media focus on AI as speculative bubble may lead to further choppiness/significant drawdowns post-prints.
<ul>
<li>High volatility expected in AI/semiconductor-exposed names (NVDA, GOOGL, MSFT) tied to Q4 commentary and AI infra demand signals. Watch for legal, regulatory, or labor cost headlines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>: Credit conditions indicators stable (Chicago Fed index), but bank earnings will show exposure to delinquencies and consumer credit trends as layoffs creep higher.</li>
<li><strong>REITs/housing</strong>: Home prices and housing starts rolling over, but no crash. 30-yr mortgage rates below 6% are increasingly plausible by Jan/Feb, supporting large landlords and mortgage-exposed REITs in near-term quarterly prints.</li>
<li><strong>Energy/materials</strong>: OPEC+ March meeting may be overshadowed by Iran/Mideast events; oil’s skew remains to the upside unless ceasefire appears credible.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare</strong>: Early/above-expected spikes in flu/measles, alongside ongoing insurance/Obamacare legal and funding risks, could drive volatility for insurers, hospital REITs, and vaccine/pharma suppliers in Q1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fixed Income &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outlook for 2026</strong>: Consensus is for Fed cuts (2–3 full moves priced in) but not a race to zero barring recession; current FRED 10y yields stable near 4.2%, 2y at 3.5%.
<ul>
<li>Steepening yield curve: Bullish for banks (wider NIM), rotation to cyclicals/value if recession is avoided.</li>
<li>TIPS demand supported by continued “above target” inflation prints and high oil risk premia.</li>
<li>Treasury refunding in early Feb and debt ceiling process will create duration supply/demand volatility—watch for relative moves in 20–30y space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Credit</strong>: Spreads not alarming but risk of short-term stress for low-rated names and EM bonds if global volatility from geopolitics erupts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities/Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil</strong>: Physical market risk premium justified by real Iran/Mideast escalation probabilities; no physical supply shock yet but event risk is elevated until OPEC+ March meeting passes.</li>
<li><strong>Gold</strong>: Growing as a defensive hedge (option market heavily bid for new highs H1 2026); gold-benefits from mix of rate cuts, inflation risk, and geopolitical shocks.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto</strong>: Flows into BTC/ETH spot ETFs remain robust; potential for SEC to green-light ETH derivative products mid-2026; crypto-aligned equities to show high correlation to ETF volume trends, but regulatory risks (banking/exchange access) remain.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Company/Special Situations</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major macro events (earnings, sector-specific regulatory cases, Fed Chair pick, and Supreme Court decisions)</strong> are still primary sources of high-beta, idiosyncratic moves (not factor-driven).</li>
<li>Certain near-term binary/catalyst situations:
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: Potential overhang or upside from surprise product updates and leadership transition headlines in Q1 (Cook succession odds rising toward mid-year).</li>
<li><strong>Nvidia, Google, Microsoft</strong>: All exposed to AI bubble narrative, model leadership press cycles, and regulatory overhang globally; immediate earnings risk is to volatility, not trend reversal.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Q4 deliveries on track but continued uncertainty over FSD, CEO succession, and soft macro auto demand.</li>
<li><strong>Disney, Netflix, Amazon</strong>: Ongoing media/streaming M&amp;A with WBD, Paramount, or others in play—sector rotation signals may emerge if consolidation accelerates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;A/IPO Watch</strong>: SpaceX, Stripe, Databricks, Discord, and major private AI/crypto infra may accelerate IPO processes post-Q1 if risk markets remain constructive.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/Altcoins</strong>: Multiple token launches and air-drops (backpacks, MegaETH, others) can support altcoin liquidity but estimates for overall crypto market cap trajectory remain highly flow dependent and at risk of sudden sentiment reversals.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance</strong>: Above-average weather risk and reinsurance claims likely for US/Asia; earthquake/catastrophe risk premium remains justified.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Second-Order and Medium-Term Themes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI sector regulation, antitrust suits</strong> to be a late-2026 story—likely to start impacting multiples, not business fundamentals, for cloud/AI majors before year-end.</li>
<li><strong>US sovereign credit rating</strong>: Another downgrade remains plausible in 2026, though hard default risk remains low; but higher treasury supply, risk premium, and funding volatility likely even in absence of crisis.</li>
<li><strong>EV/green energy policy</strong>: US still off-pace for 2030 targets; climate/energy transition names face ongoing repositioning and factor rotation as political environment hardens into pre-election mode.</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical shocks</strong> (Iran, Taiwan, Russia): Outlier/fat-tail scenarios (e.g. oil &gt;$85, forced tech supply shocks) remain left tail risk for global beta and add value to defensive/hedge exposures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
