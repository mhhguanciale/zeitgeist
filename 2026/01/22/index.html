<li>January blizzard across Northeast/Atlantic corridor, likely disrupting travel/insurance/retail.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>US Macro &amp; Fed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Labor, PCE, and CPI data steady to soft; rate markets price for no near-term Fed policy shifts.</li>
<li>FOMC meeting/Powell press conference next week; watch for dissents, recession rhetoric.</li>
<li>Government funding risk remains; deadline/funding votes over the next 2 weeks.</li>
<li>Core CPI and PCE running at elevated mid-3% YoY range (as of last print), but some year-end deceleration.</li>
<li>Treasury curve significantly de-inverted (10s–2s: ~+70bps), easing prior recession signals.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tech &amp; AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google is the clear AI leader on latest model benchmarks; sector concentration persists (NVDA as market cap leader).</li>
<li>Apple on track for iPhone 18 and possible foldable device release this year; hardware refresh cycle expected to drive Q4 results.</li>
<li>OpenAI/Anthropic/Discord/SpaceX/Databricks IPOs generally pushed to late 2026+; weaker pipeline for large tech IPO supply in H1.</li>
<li>AI/Big Tech firms openly referenced “regulation”/“antitrust”/“cloud”/“quantum” in upcoming earnings—expect continued sector headline risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commodities &amp; Crypto</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Oil stabilizing $57–$60; risk skew remains to upside on Middle East, nominal volatility sudden on headlines (Strait of Hormuz/tanker seizures).</li>
<li>Gold and silver strong upward momentum; price targets receiving upgrades from bulge-bracket banks, reflecting heightened geopolitical hedge demand.</li>
<li>Bitcoin/Ethereum/Solana/XRP—all high realized and expected vol; short-term ETF inflows turn negative/neutral, technicals challenged but long-run macro outlook has substantial bid.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notable Legal/Regulatory</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCOTUS likely to side with Trump on FTC commissioner removal; rolling back regulatory independence on M&amp;A/tech oversight.</li>
<li>NYT vs. OpenAI legal battle could shape liability and valuations for LLM firms—focus on copyright precedent.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Rates</h2>
<h3>Rates, Inflation, and Central Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fed will likely hold steady at January and February meetings; multiple dissents possible, but “pause” scenario remains dominant.</li>
<li>10-year Treasury yield trending 4.15–4.3%, with de-inverting curve (positive 10s–2s spread) and rising long-end supply risk.</li>
<li>No urgency for aggressive rate cuts; market expects at most a modest pivot by mid-year.</li>
<li>Inflation (core CPI/PCE) running between 3.3–3.6% YoY as of late Q4/early Q1; stickier than official projections.</li>
<li>Wage growth running in-line with inflation; real wage gains still modest, but unlikely to drive additional “demand-pull” inflation in 1H.</li>
<li>USD broadly stable and near multi-year highs; FX upside risks if US/EU divergence or geopolitical escalates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal/Government</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elevated risk of a short-term government shutdown in February/March; most scenarios point to a “kick-the-can” continuing resolution.</li>
<li>Another credit rating downgrade and/or X-date debt ceiling crisis remains a nonzero risk for Q2/Q3, especially if bipartisan gridlock persists.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Macro/Global Growth</h3>
<ul>
<li>US GDP tracking for a “soft landing” (2026 consensus/market expects 2.5–3.0% growth).</li>
<li>European/UK data continues to underwhelm, Germany flirting with mild recession; China GDP signals stabilization, but no dramatic turn.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors</h2>
<h3>Defense, Energy, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East risk premium persists in oil/gold; WTI $57–$60 but low spare capacity, potential for price spikes if Israel/Iran or Iranian regime destabilizes.</li>
<li>Defense spending and aerospace supply chains have substantial catalysts from ongoing conflicts; Defense sector earnings in focus late Jan–Feb.</li>
<li>Insurance, reinsurance, and catastrophe exposure may be tested due to winter storm and elevated natural catastrophe probability this year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technology &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI sector concentration: Google leads on model capability; NVDA largest global company by market cap on most time horizons.</li>
<li>AI regulation probability rising, but low odds for major US legislation in the next 6 months.</li>
<li>AI copyright and data privacy exposure in S&amp;P tech names (GOOGL, MSFT, META, AAPL) remains a litigation overhang.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials</h3>
<ul>
<li>Market expects stability for large US banks; no systemic risk headlines, but idiosyncratic bankruptcy/failure risk remains for smaller and EM institutions through H1.</li>
<li>Fed and fiscal outcomes will drive performance going into Q1 earnings/sectors with duration/credit sensitivity (banks, mortgages, REITs).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Consumer</h3>
<ul>
<li>Retail and services showing soft, but positive QoQ prints; consumer sentiment subdued but not collapsing.</li>
<li>Housing price inflation stable, but rate/cost headwinds will pressure affordability in major metros; legislative risk on institutional/SFR restrictiveness is rising.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Healthcare</h3>
<ul>
<li>Measles outbreak and insurance risk tail—US cases above historic averages, manageable but operational drag for certain insurers/healthcare providers.</li>
<li>Healthcare legislation remains up in the air; ACA credit extensions less likely, resulting in second-half potential for lower healthcare consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Crypto sector is at a technical inflection—ETF flows are lackluster, tail risk remains with regulatory/litigation risk and macro volatility.</li>
<li>Bitcoin and gold both have credible (but not dominant) chance for best-of-year performance in 2026; volatility spikes likely on escalation in Mid-East/EM.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names &amp; Events</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVDA:</strong> Structural winner from every major AI benchmark; short-term volatility driven by AI spending pause risk, longer-term leadership solid.</li>
<li><strong>AAPL:</strong> Anticipated iPhone 18/foldable launch; hardware cycle critical for sustaining margins, watch China supply chain/consumer sentiment.</li>
<li><strong>TSLA:</strong> Key focus on Q1 delivery numbers, Semi and energy business trajectory; risk of downside surprise, with uncertain leadership/ESG narrative.</li>
<li><strong>OPEN/MSTR/COIN:</strong> Binary event flow (bankruptcy/solvency triggers, court outcomes, or crypto ETF flows) could drive outsized returns or losses.</li>
<li><strong>DIS/NFLX/PARA/WBD:</strong> Media M&amp;A cycle heating up, with Netflix seen as probable acquirer of WBD; content supply and consolidation headlines likely through H1.</li>
<li><strong>Banks (JPM/MS/GS):</strong> No material change to underwriting pipeline; Fed/legislation outcomes and M&amp;A execution are the main watchpoints.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Near-Term Market Structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 near highs, but market breadth remains narrow. “AI/Big Tech” much stronger than cyclicals, but Q1–Q2 risk/reward flattening.</li>
<li>Volatility at the index level subdued, but event-driven spikes likely (Fed, shutdown, geopolitical).</li>
<li>First-order event to watch: FOMC (Jan 28–29); second-order: government shutdown headlines, global inflation upside/commodity/minor war shocks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
