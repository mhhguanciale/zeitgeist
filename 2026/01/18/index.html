<h2>Macro Themes</h2>
<h3>US (Monetary, Fiscal)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Policy Direction</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prediction markets assign a near-certain probability to “no change” at the January FOMC; dissent risk is non-zero but not market-disruptive.</li>
<li>FRED: Core inflation rising gradually (Core CPI 331.9 in Dec, core PCE prints firm), but no evidence of reacceleration. 10Y yield ~4.17% and 2Y yield ~3.5%; curve has steepened, but remains flat vs. history.</li>
<li><strong>Second order</strong>: Near-term yield volatility likely to remain muted; focus will pivot to Q1 GDP and labor prints in Feb/Mar for any rate path change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Risk: Shutdown, Tariffs, and Credit</strong>
<ul>
<li>Government funding risks resurface around March; probability of a short shutdown remains nontrivial.</li>
<li>House/Senate partisan control in November midterms will impact spending and debt paths; probability market implies a high likelihood Democrats control House, Republicans take Senate.</li>
<li>U.S. debt path: Consensus for national debt to surge past $40T by 2027, pressuring Treasury auctions and risk premia (bonds, inflation-protected).</li>
<li>Greenland tariffs (and EU response) adds a risk premium to US-EU trade and G7 FX (EUR/USD, USD/JPY).</li>
<li>Credit card rate caps are back in play, unsettling consumer banks and nonbank lenders.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro/FX</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Energy/Commodities</strong>
<ul>
<li>High uncertainty on timing of actual US/Israel-Iran attack, but risk premium building in oil (WTI firming above $58); Suez/Strait of Hormuz closure probability is material.</li>
<li>Prediction markets and news suggest up to 60% probability of direct military engagement by end-Q2, with second-order effects on marine insurance and energy/logistics stocks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>
<ul>
<li>GDP signals mostly soft, with German contraction and UK stagnation; ECB and BoE on hold in January but tone is vigilantly dependent on US/Fed.</li>
<li>EUR/USD is steady, but threatened by new US tariffs and any shock from the Euro area debt downgrade risk (~30% probability).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector/Niche Themes</h2>
<h3>Defense &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Defense contractors</strong> poised for further upside on US/Iran/Israel/MENA tensions; gold and oil likely see safe-haven bids on escalation headlines.</li>
<li><strong>Energy</strong>: Greenland/EU/US resource disputes raise the possibility of new resource nationalism, favorable for US critical minerals/mining chains.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Big Tech &amp; AI</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI</strong>: Ongoing &quot;AI bubble&quot; risk flagged by high-profile investors; AI hardware/software sector (Nvidia, Alphabet, Apple, MSFT) faces heightened upside and tail-risk as earnings season approaches.</li>
<li>Google’s “Gemini” AI integration into Apple Siri sets tone for cross-platform LLM adoption. Bank of America notes new Google partnerships as a &quot;game changer.&quot;</li>
<li>Most prediction markets see Google maintaining the AI lead through H1; OpenAI IPO unlikely pre-2027.</li>
<li>Major tech earnings (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, META) are upcoming and will give crucial data on Q4 demand and guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Antitrust/Regulation</strong>: Legal risk for big platforms (Apple, Amazon, Meta, Google) persists, but markets not assigning immediate threat from SCOTUS/FTC cases.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financials &amp; Lending</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sitting uneasily between falling rates and policy uncertainty, especially around credit card caps and potential for new financial regulation.</li>
<li>Mortgage rates are hovering (6.4–6.5% on 30yr); no rate shock expected before late Q1 barring new Fed signals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing &amp; REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Case-Shiller and FRED show home price index flatlining; housing starts plateauing—which, paired with high rates and potential for regulatory hits (possible single-family REIT restrictions), could weigh on sector multiples.</li>
<li>Weather disruptions from winter storms introduce operational and insurance event risk for Midwest/East US.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto, Commodities &amp; Alternatives</h3>
<ul>
<li>BTC/crypto: Significant flows into US bitcoin ETFs predicted this week (positive net probability), but volatility remains high; regulatory/custody and Iran/geopolitical moves could whipsaw short-term performance.</li>
<li>BTC remains favored to outperform gold/real assets in H1. Measurable M&amp;A and token launch activity in DeFi/crypto infra space; few large bankruptcies expected near-term.</li>
<li>Measles outbreaks and public health risks could disrupt schools, local economies, and near-term insurer (and public sector) perceptions.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Single-name/Company Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nvidia</strong>: On path to retain world’s largest market cap through summer; risk is to the upside if Q4 earnings confirm AI/data center leadership.</li>
<li><strong>Apple</strong>: New management speculation persists but little probability of a sudden change in 2026; main risks are product execution and possible US/EU antitrust moves. Google Gemini partnership supports bullish AI narrative.</li>
<li><strong>Tesla</strong>: Deliveries and production risk flagged for Q1; high likelihood of news around “robotaxi”/FSD but street expects no “full autonomy” product launch this half. CEO risk remains low pre-2027.</li>
<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: Cloud/AI earnings expected strong; cross-exposure to OpenAI outcomes less binary with Google’s Gemini partnership shifting LLM landscape.</li>
<li><strong>Meta</strong>: Still advertiser-dominated; regulatory risk from social platform/AI debates is rising but earnings sentiment positive.</li>
<li><strong>Boeing/Defense</strong>: Recent geopolitical events and headlines keep the group in play as a crowded consensus &quot;hedge&quot; for macro risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Other: Major Poll, Regulatory, and Geopolitical Watch Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>US policy path:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tensions between tariffs, spending, and fiscal hawks will add headline risk in coming months, especially with the next shutdown window opening in March and tariffs taking effect.</li>
<li>High probability of aggressive rhetoric/negotiation but low probability of &quot;hard&quot; default on US debt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Elections</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Democratic odds firm for House in 2026, Republican odds increasing for Senate. 2028 permutations too early to matter in positioning, but market not pricing radical change.</li>
<li>State policy (e.g., CA billionaire tax, MI/NY/NJ home value trends) relevant for regional/municipal bond and REIT allocation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Pandemic/Health</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Measles/pandemic risk is non-negligible (esp. in Pacific Northwest); watch insurers, travel, and local REITs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Climate/Natural Disaster</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Ongoing US/EU/China posturing on climate goals. 2°C warming &quot;tipping point&quot; is viewed as an eventual, not shelf-life, risk; little change to 2026 flows.</li>
<li>Arctic/Greenland weather, resource, and shipping stories have entered the mainstream narrative; could reshape long-cycle views on supply chain resiliency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
