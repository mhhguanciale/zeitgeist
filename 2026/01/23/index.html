<h2>Macroeconomic &amp; Cross-Asset</h2>
<h3>US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Rates &amp; Policy</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Market expects the Fed to hold rates steady in Jan with significant internal dissent (FOMC split, policy uncertainty).</li>
<li>Dot plot and forward guidance risk further volatility mid-year as cuts become a Q2–Q3 debate.</li>
<li>10Y yield trending up (recently ~4.24–4.3%); yield curve still modestly positive between 2Y/10Y.</li>
<li>Chicago Fed Financial Conditions Index: Easing trend, supports risk assets and credit spreads for now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Labor &amp; Growth</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Payrolls: Job growth continues, but at subdued pace. Latest monthly gains (~50-70k) remain soft.</li>
<li>Unemployment trend: Tick up to 4.4% in late 2025, mirroring a cooling but not collapsing labor market.</li>
<li>Michigan sentiment remains low (latest: 51), a drag on durables and discretionary.</li>
<li>GDP expected stable-to-strong for Q4 and into 2026 (growth &gt;2% likely). Recession not near-term base case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflation</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CPI Core and Core PCE running at suppressed but sticky levels: Recent prints flat to +0.2% MoM (FRED); YoY trending near 3.2–3.4%, still above target.</li>
<li>CPI and PCE surprise in either direction at Jan/Feb releases could shift short-rate and equity volatility sharply.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fiscal</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CR/government funding deadline (Jan 31) presents headline risk for rates, defense, and federal contractors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>USD</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trade-weighted DXY marginally bid up, sustaining USD strength; mild disinflation plus global tensions keep flows to USD assets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Non-US Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>
<ul>
<li>Snap election risk and ongoing BoJ hesitancy destabilize JPY; modest pressure on yield control and global carry trades.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Europe</strong>
<ul>
<li>German/UK macro remains sluggish; ECB likely on hold, but a cut more probable than a hike in Q2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>China</strong>
<ul>
<li>China trade/growth dialogue planned (H1 2026); rare earths and industrial supply chains resurfacing as policy risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sector &amp; Theme Highlights</h2>
<h3>Geopolitics, Commodities &amp; Energy</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Israel-Gaza, Lebanon, Yemen: Near-daily large-scale events; odds for US/Israel strikes on Iran, and for Strait of Hormuz closure, have materially increased (multiple near-term catalyst dates).</li>
<li>Any closure or attacks on Persian Gulf infrastructure/Oil terminals would rapidly move oil $5–$15 higher and stress global shipping/insurance—tailwinds for energy equities, crude, and safe havens (gold, USD).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Russia/Ukraine</strong>
<ul>
<li>Talks ongoing but no resolution; baseline for high energy/gas price volatility in Europe.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Weather</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blizzards across NE, Midwest and weather-related infrastructure risk could impact transportation, utilities, insurance, chemicals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rates, Credit &amp; Housing</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bonds</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Treasury yields rising, especially on the long-end (FRED: 10Y recently back above 4.25%). Inflation remains sticky, limiting scope for multiple Fed cuts in 2026.</li>
<li>Any FOMC/Funding event surprise, or government shutdown, could move yields and TIPs/Breakevens, and drive risk-off moves.</li>
<li>Mortgage rates: Trend still &gt;6%; little relief for housing affordability or REIT balance sheets.</li>
<li>US debt trajectory and likely political standoffs mean elevated downgrade/credit risk premium for Treasuries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Housing</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Housing starts and Case-Shiller reflect a stagnant to slightly soft market (no acceleration in supply or prices).</li>
<li>Upcoming reports may show further weakness if job market cools further and/or rates stay high. Homebuilder and REITs likely to underperform cyclicals absent a sustained drop in yields.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Equities (US, Tech, Banks)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Major Indices</strong>
<ul>
<li>S&amp;P, Nasdaq near highs; high probability for positive YoY finish, but tactically vulnerable to any macro/geopolitical spillover.</li>
<li>Prediction market still shows balanced risks around index trajectory into late Q1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tech</strong>
<ul>
<li>AI sector still dominates narrative—Nvidia is now base case favorite for world’s largest company by mid-year. Severe megacap index concentration: Any miss or negative commentary could spark outsized moves.</li>
<li>Major Q4 earnings lineup for tech in coming weeks is major single-stock and index event risk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>
<ul>
<li>Bank earnings in focus—credit quality holding steady, but watch for any commentary on CRE, consumer delinquencies, or deposit flight.</li>
<li>Several large US and Euro banks seen to have default risk priced higher for 2026 (DB, Citi, GS, UBS, etc. in options/futures).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thematic/Other</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health</strong>
<ul>
<li>Measles &amp; vaccine headlines—renewed scrutiny for managed care, hospitals, and major insurers. Bid for vaccine/IP drug makers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fintech/Startups</strong>
<ul>
<li>M&amp;A at ~50% discount to previous highs (Brex) shows further reset for late-stage fintech valuations. Negative for PE/VC marks, and possible drag for IPO sentiment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>AI/Cloud</strong>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI, Google-Gemini, xAI frequent earnings mention expected; incremental model launches (Grok 4.x, Gemini 3) impact who wins spending on cloud/semis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Crypto/ETFs</strong>
<ul>
<li>Flows into spot Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs are now a short-term swing factor for listed prices and associated miners/exchanges.</li>
<li>Crypto volatility remains ultra-high: daily moves can reinforce sentiment (risk-on/risk-off); altcoin airdrop cycles keep retail in the narrative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Individual Names and Catalyst Watch</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tesla:</strong> AI, FSD, Robotaxi, China/Tariffs, and battery tech highlighted in coming earnings. Volume/ASP trends and full autonomy comments are primary risk factors.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, Google/Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, JPM:</strong> Mega-cap earnings cluster (late Jan–mid Feb) is the next major test for overall US equity froth.</li>
<li><strong>Capital One:</strong> Brex acquisition is a sign of further consolidation in fintech at heavy discounts, may be a bullish M&amp;A signal for large incumbents with cash.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Upcoming Catalysts</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jan 28</strong> – January 2026 FOMC Meeting &amp; Rate Decision: Decision on cuts/stance will set tone across markets (rates, banks, growth/value).</li>
<li><strong>Jan 31</strong> – December 2025 Core PCE Inflation Release: Key for forward Fed path; hotter/cooler than expected changes bonds, USD, equity multiples.</li>
<li><strong>Jan 31</strong> – US government funding deadline: Any lapse triggers risk-off, especially for defense, contractors, and Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Late Jan–mid Feb</strong> – Q4 Major Tech &amp; Bank Earnings: Guidance on AI/cloud, consumer, ad spending, and loan quality likely to drive broad market moves.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 5</strong> – Treasury Refunding Announcement: Impacts long-duration yields, supply/demand for Treasuries.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 6</strong> – January 2026 Nonfarm Payrolls: Direct impact on USD, rates, cyclicals.</li>
<li><strong>Feb (monthly through April)</strong> – Major Housing Data Releases (CPI Shelter, Case-Shiller, Sales): Trickle-down to builder/REITs, mortgage stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Feb 27</strong> – Q4 2025 GDP Second Estimate: Will confirm/revise growth trajectory for cyclical names.</li>
<li><strong>Early March</strong> – Nvidia GTC 2026 Conference: Major AI/semi supplier event.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 11</strong> – February 2026 CPI: Inflation print can reprice both front-end and long-end rates.</li>
<li><strong>Mar 18</strong> – March FOMC (Dot Plot): Major inflection for forward rates and duration assets.</li>
<li><strong>Mar</strong> – OPEC+ Policy Meeting: Oil/energy supply/demand recalibration—impacts energy, transport sector.</li>
<li><strong>March–June</strong> – ECB, BOJ Policy Meetings: Potential for surprise easing/tightening and spillover to USD, EUR, JPY FX/rates.</li>
<li><strong>H1 2026</strong> – US–China Trade &amp; Economic Dialogue: Eventual agreements impact semis, EM, and USD.</li>
<li><strong>June</strong> – US Supreme Court decisions cluster: Tech, regulation-sensitive sectors could see sudden repricing.</li>
<li><strong>Monthly</strong> – ISM Manufacturing/Services: Recession signal, cyclicals/industrials, forward risk.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>Key tactical risks remain from US government funding, FOMC “pause/cut” ambiguity, heightened geopolitical friction in the Middle East, and the Q4 big-tech earnings cycle. Cross-asset positioning should reflect late-cycle stickiness in inflation, strong but slowing US labor, and fat-tail scenarios in energy/commodities from regional military escalation.</strong></p>
