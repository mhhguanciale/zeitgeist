    <h1>Daily Memo (12-Jan-2026)</h1>
<h2>News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Middle East Escalation</strong>: Trump signals hardline stance toward Cuba after regime change in Venezuela; warnings to regional allies as US-Iran tensions intensify; Iranian protest death toll surpasses 500 and regime faces growing instability; large anti-Iran rallies in major US cities.</li>
<li><strong>Iran–US/Israel Risk</strong>: Second- and third-order effects expected as US prosecutors reportedly open a probe into Fed Chair Powell, raising uncertainty for USD and rates; Iran “edges closer” to regime change; large-scale protests prompt speculation on possible US or Israeli military action.</li>
<li><strong>Credit Card Regulation</strong>: Trump calls for a cap on credit card rates, sending bank stocks (Citi, JPMorgan) lower.</li>
<li><strong>China–EU EV Tariffs</strong>: China and EU reach a consensus on price undertakings for electric vehicles, reducing short-term tariff escalation risk and supporting auto/EV equities.</li>
<li><strong>Australia Wildfires</strong>: Nearly 900,000 acres burned; insurance/reinsurance exposures may rise.</li>
<li><strong>Social Media Regulation</strong>: Meta blocks over 550,000 accounts under Australia’s new child safety law, signaling increased compliance costs and possible global spillover for tech.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Macro: Economic, Rates, and Policy</h2>
<h3>US Macro Health</h3>
<ul>
<li>Core inflation (CPI, PCE) remains sticky but not accelerating; retail sales and nonfarm payrolls are steady, no sharp contraction or overheating signals.</li>
<li>FRED: Latest unemployment rate at 4.4%, slightly elevated but not recessionary; job openings have edged down, but no collapse.</li>
<li>Recession risk for 2026 remains modest; prediction market pricing does not reflect a high probability of imminent negative GDP prints.</li>
<li>10Y yields stable near 4.15–4.20%, 2Y at ~3.47%: modest curve steepening, but no signs of disorderly dislocation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fed &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li>Next FOMC (1/28) likely to maintain current rate; incremental odds on a dissent but not full shift to cuts.</li>
<li>Multiple events (debt ceiling, Q4 GDP, inflation/PCE) will feed into market expectations for March/June meetings—rate cuts most likely to come in latter half of Q1 or Q2 unless crisis erupts.</li>
<li>Market is discounting 2–3 rate cuts in 2026, but no rapid easing cycle (no “emergency” environment priced barring a left-tail shock).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal/Regulatory</h3>
<ul>
<li>Biden impeachment and federal investigations around Powell/DOJ (if realized) could spark acute volatility in USD and Treasuries, but probabilities remain relatively low near-term.</li>
<li>Proposed credit card interest rate caps—if pursued—would drive margin compression in consumer banks, push lending risk to non-banks, and expand demand for unsecured personal loans (tailwind for select fintech).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation Outlook</h3>
<ul>
<li>Short-term inflation expectations remain anchored; both market and FRED series show no major re-acceleration.</li>
<li>Commodity inflation: WTI at $57–$59, US gas prices stable; supply-side major risk only if there is real escalation in the Gulf or Strait of Hormuz closures.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Global Macro &amp; Geopolitics</h2>
<h3>Energy, Oil, Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Middle East: Heightened probability of kinetic strikes involving US/Israel and Iran, but no consensus on imminent full-scale war. Near-term, desk risk setups skew toward call risk for energy/defense if escalation.
<ul>
<li>If Iran regime falls or Strait of Hormuz closes, expect rapid oil spike and renewed volatility in global rates, EM FX, and gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Venezuela: Recent regime ouster and subsequent “deal” posturing will affect EM bonds and oil majors; impact on crude supply and secondary effects on regional stability/energy flows.</li>
<li>China–EU: Price agreement on EVs reduces overhang for EU auto/tech/battery sectors; averted worst-case for tariffs but sector capex still faces margin risk if US/EU demand sags.</li>
</ul>
<h3>US-China/Asia</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk of US–China diplomatic blowup or trade shock remains, but event risk contained in near-term catalysts. Semiconductors remain key “fulcrum” sector—no clear signal of immediate license escalations.</li>
<li>Japan: Wildcard snap election risk; JPY stability likely barring BOJ policy shift.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors and Thematic</h2>
<h3>Financials/Banks</h3>
<ul>
<li>US megabanks pressured by card regulatory headlines and macro volatility (yield curve, pending rate path). Potential margin spread compression if rate caps gain traction.</li>
<li>Continued low probability of “systemic” US bank failures—modest elevated vigilance but no acute stress (per FRED conditions index).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tech/AI/Cloud</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI/Cloud: AI platform firms (GOOGL, MSFT, AAPL) dominate top-of-mind. AI regulation risk (US/EU) remains mostly background; lawsuits/antitrust themes persistent but not near decisive inflections.</li>
<li>Social media/content: Regulatory pushback (Australia ban, US/UK/EU compliance) creates sustained but manageable margin headwinds.</li>
<li>Awaiting Q4 reporting from megacaps—second-order risks around capex, margins (AI scaling), and regulatory cost growth.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Autos/EVs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tariff détente (China–EU) a positive for global auto/EV exporters; reopening of EU/China channels could push new deal flow.</li>
<li>US EV/auto production &amp; deliveries will be scrutinized in upcoming earnings cycle—no market signal of a demand collapse, but ongoing margin compression/investment pressure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commodities/Gold</h3>
<ul>
<li>Gold trading firm, but macro does not point toward an imminent safe-haven bid unless Middle East blows up or US-EU debt standoff materializes.</li>
<li>No major ags or metals shocks despite Australia wildfire destruction; insurance/reinsurance facing mounting claims exposure.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing/REITs</h3>
<ul>
<li>US housing pricing steady; no evidence yet of outright reversal. 30y mortgage rates below 6.5%, supporting affordability.</li>
<li>Institutional SFR legislation odds rising but not actionable without hard legislative progress.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Financials</strong>: C, JPM downside on card cap headlines; fintech lenders (SOFI, block) may benefit as users seek alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/AI</strong>: MSFT, GOOGL, META, NVDA driving narrative—major regulatory actions would be disruptive but timing is not near-term.</li>
<li><strong>Auto/EV</strong>: Focus for earnings (TSLA, F, GM) will be on demand and EU tariff relief; any new subsidies/import mechanisms (from EU/China side) would be material.</li>
<li><strong>Energy/Oil</strong>: Majors (XOM, CVX, BP, Total) would see tail risk premium expansion in actual Gulf/MENA supply crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Insurance/REITs</strong>: Insurers with California/Australia CAT risk likely to guide to higher claims and reinsurance costs.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer/Payments</strong>: Card networks (MA, V) and big banks may face EPS and volume squeeze if US card caps enacted.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
