    <h1>Daily Memo (19-Jan-2026)</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Key News Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trump Tariffs Escalate:</strong> EU discussing $108B in retaliatory tariffs, UK, Germany, and Denmark push back strongly. US-Canada-China auto/trade tensions are rising.</li>
<li><strong>Greenland Tensions:</strong> German/NATO activity and US “threats” raising market/equities volatility across EUR, DKK, energy supply, and logistics sectors.</li>
<li><strong>Maduro Regime Power:</strong> Venezuela’s Cabello emerging as central in regime stability, with US “backchannel” diplomacy ongoing.</li>
<li><strong>FBI, ICE, and Minneapolis:</strong> US domestic unrest plays into broader perceptions of policy risk, with ICE activity, law enforcement deployment, and related counterprotests.</li>
<li><strong>Portugal Elections:</strong> Center left win increases the probability of policy stability in EU peripheral sovereigns, but a far-right runoff is now set.</li>
<li><strong>Central Bank/Fed Watch:</strong> Supreme Court to rule on executive powers over Fed appointments, watch for tension between Trump administration and Fed officials (notably Lisa Cook and Chair Powell).</li>
<li><strong>Canada EV Tariffs:</strong> Canada’s tariff cut allows Chinese EV imports, sharply undercutting US/European prices and exposing North American autos to deflationary Asian competition.</li>
<li><strong>Middle East Security:</strong> Seven police killed in Guatemala; continued instability in MENA (notably Iran and Yemen) and Venezuela.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Risks:</strong> US measles cases and public vaccine hesitancy rising; no new autism linkage in Tylenol pregnancy study.</li>
<li><strong>Offshore Wind Setback:</strong> Trump wins wind-farm policy delays in court, but overall momentum against anti-climate measures persistent.</li>
<li><strong>Major US/Mega-cap Earnings:</strong> Earnings calendar for financials, tech, and mega-cap growth stocks in focus for next two weeks.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Market Level</h2>
<h3>US Macro + Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed Pause, Multiple Dissenters Expected:</strong> Markets now heavily anticipate a Fed pause at January’s FOMC with two or more dissents. Probability for a 25bp cut is low but not zero; rates could remain “higher for longer” until mid-year barring a sharp payroll/credit shock.</li>
<li><strong>Yield Curve Steepening:</strong> 10y–2y and 10y–3m Treasury spreads have normalized, both now positive after years inverted. This reduces immediate recession signal, though a soft landing is not confirmed.</li>
<li><strong>Labor Market:</strong> Unemployment (FRED Dec: 4.4%, trending gently higher) and nonfarm payrolls show a maturing rather than overheating cycle. Job growth is flattening; risk of further slack increasing through spring.</li>
<li><strong>Inflation:</strong> Core CPI and PCE both slowly grind higher, &gt;3% YoY; January CPI expected &gt;2.5%. Fed is unlikely to turn dovish pre-March, barring a labor shock or new crisis.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer:</strong> Early Michigan Sentiment in Q1 was weak but improving slightly as real wage growth remains positive over CPI.</li>
<li><strong>Fiscal Cliff/Shutdown Risk:</strong> Government funding bills and debt ceiling debates (March CR expiry) could induce near-term volatility in rates, large-caps, and value/cyclicals.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Global Macro</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>EU/UK Political Stability:</strong> Portugal leans center-left, reducing further euro-periphery tail risk. Meanwhile, German/Scandinavian supply chains and auto sectors face direct and indirect tariff headwinds from US and new Canada/China deals.</li>
<li><strong>BOJ/ECB:</strong> Both central banks in hold mode, but JPY and EUR at risk of trade-related volatility/weakness if tariffs/energy shocks escalate.</li>
<li><strong>Commodities:</strong> Oil ticks upward on Ukraine tanker strikes and MENA/US-Iran risk; Canada lifts constraint on Chinese EVs, pushing supply chain and commodity disinflation.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Asset Classes</h2>
<h3>Equities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>US Index Levels:</strong> Both S&amp;P 500 and QQQ sit within 2–3% of ATHs but show increased volatility around macro events and earnings—range-bound until further Fed clarity or earnings surprises.</li>
<li><strong>Sector Rotation:</strong> Ongoing flows from defensives (utilities, staples, REITs) toward tech and select AI-linked names, but with cyclical value outperformance on tariff and credit risk days.</li>
<li><strong>Financials:</strong> Q4 bank earnings (next two weeks) will be a litmus test for loan quality, reserves, and credit cards amid Trump policy uncertainty (credit card rate cap concern is rising). Margin pressure will be watched closely.</li>
<li><strong>Tech/Semis:</strong> Q4 earnings and AI conference season are main event risk for mega-caps. Nvidia, AMD, and memory suppliers may see order growth but “inventory risk” appears, as Asian Capacity and Canadian EV supply spikes.</li>
<li><strong>Autos:</strong> US and European OEMs threatened by Canada’s Chinese EV import decision—a deflationary threat to US auto pricing, especially mid-tier and EV-centric suppliers.</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Oil and services inch higher with OPEC+ price discipline and conflict in Ukraine/MENA. Tariff risk on non-energy imports is a net positive for US energy, neutral-negative for exporters.</li>
<li><strong>REITs/Mortgages:</strong> 30Y mortgage rates easing below 6%, with housing and price indexes gradually rebounding but risk remains should labor market trend deteriorate.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonds/Credit</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treasuries:</strong> 2Y: ~3.5%; 10Y: 4.15–4.19%. Credit spreads compressed, but rising dissent within FOMC and treasury financing needs may drive volatility into late Q1.</li>
<li><strong>IG/HY Credit:</strong> Spreads stable; next risk event is deterioration in labor market or surprise in credit card/consumer default rates.</li>
<li><strong>MBS/Housing:</strong> Housing starts and builder data show stabilization, but institutional SFR purchase ban legislation risk is still live for 2026.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives / Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gold:</strong> Steady to strong amid trade and geopolitical tensions; headlines raise tail risk hedging flows.</li>
<li><strong>Crypto:</strong> ETF flows remain positive; BTC holds high ground, ETH and SOL also stable. High realized/expected volatility favors disciplined allocation, with all-time-high chase risk in altcoins where ETF participation grows. On-chain ETF flows and Bitcoin/ETH options activity drive short-term price action.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Geopolitics, Regulation &amp; Policy</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Tariffs/Trade Policy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trump’s tariffs against Europe/Canada/China lead the global macro agenda.</li>
<li>US, EU, UK, Germany, Denmark now directly at odds; retaliation risk is real, especially for autos, tech hardware, and agriculture. US corporate supply chains at risk (esp. autos, tech hardware).</li>
<li>Canadian allowance of Chinese EVs highlights cracks in USMCA-style unity, worsening competitive threat to US and EU automakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fed/Regulation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>SCOTUS to rule on Trump’s ability to swap Fed members—possible turnover risk to Fed Chair/Board in 2026.</li>
<li>Regulatory/antitrust: Tech (Google earnings) and finance (credit cards) both under scrutiny for potential consumer protection or pricing action.</li>
<li>Energy/Climate: Offshore wind delays may relieve short-term capex outlays (neutral-positive for utilities), but the overall trend is to maintain subsidy and infrastructure build for “AI/data-center” energy needs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Middle East, Oil &amp; Energy:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ongoing strikes, tanker disruptions in Black Sea, Yemen, and Iran keep oil bid. Any major escalation (Iran/US direct clash or Hormuz closure) would disrupt macro risk assets and likely sharply spike oil and gold.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company-Specific (High-impact/near-term focus)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mega-cap Tech / AI:</strong> Earnings from AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL etc. risk event for market sentiment and QQQ weighting. AI models and new platform launches will be watched for margin expansion/competition narratives, especially in (cloud/data-center) capex guidance.</li>
<li><strong>Auto/OEMs:</strong> US automakers face a margin and demand headwind from China/Canada EV deals—watch for guidance revisions during next round of earnings. Tesla’s commentary on Chinese competition, tariffs, and commercial deliveries highly relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Banks:</strong> Watch for Q4 chargeoff trends, guidance on Net Interest Margins, and forward credit risk. Rate cap risk on credit cards/tightening margin is a clear negative if policy advances.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare/Biotech:</strong> Measles and vaccine headlines point to ongoing tail risk; no new autism linkage, but public health headlines can impact insurers and managed care/consumer-oriented health stocks.</li>
<li><strong>Streaming/Media:</strong> Netflix global ratings stable; US/Europe M&amp;A speculation (Warner/Paramount/Netflix) is live. M&amp;A headlines could drive significant re-rating for all US streaming names.</li>
</ul>
