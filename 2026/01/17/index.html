<hr />
<h2>Macro &amp; Policy</h2>
<h3>Monetary Policy &amp; Rates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fed pause holding, but easing bias building:</strong> Upcoming FOMC is widely expected to hold rates steady, with the FRED showing a deceleration in CPI/PCE prints and softening consumer sentiment. However, there is growing speculation (derived from both news, prediction market lean, and FRED data) that a rate cut cycle will begin by summer, with risk of a deeper front-loaded move if job market weakens further.</li>
<li><strong>Yield curve steepening:</strong> The 2s/10s curve moved to its least inverted stance since 2023, signaling easing recession and lower-for-longer policy expectations. Risk assets may price in multiple cuts through H2 as growth slows.</li>
<li><strong>US credit risk:</strong> Substantial probability of a further credit rating downgrade or a protracted funding showdown in Q1; rates volatility could spike if negotiations toward March/April falter.</li>
<li><strong>Dollar:</strong> Slight broad dollar weakening seen YTD; not crisis-level but reflects yield convergence expectations and US funding pressure. Ongoing geopolitical flare-ups remain a support for safe haven USD.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fiscal &amp; Legislative</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2026 Budget, funding drama:</strong> Federal budget/deficit and debt ceiling talks will be a flashpoint through March—risk for liquidity, T-bill yields, and possible market dislocation.</li>
<li><strong>Tariffs/Trade:</strong> High chance of new/revised US tariffs, especially directed at China and potentially Greenland-issue-linked nations. Tariff “stimulus check” idea circulating but not yet actionable.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare reform uncertainty:</strong> Trump’s new “health plan” lacks clarity but distracts from ACA and Medicaid policy continuity; MCOs, hospital spending, and drug suppliers face short-term headline risk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Labor Market</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unemployment rise is baked in:</strong> Rate now ~4.4%; market sees a non-negligible chance of hitting 5%+ this year—already visible in higher continuing claims and flat/negative payrolls trend in late-2025 data (FRED).</li>
<li><strong>Labor force participation weak; job openings fall:</strong> JOLTS data in slow decline—underpins wage pressure for lower-skill segments, but job market no longer overheating. More pain is likely for consumer cyclicals and industrials exposed to lower-volume demand.</li>
<li><strong>Tech layoffs accelerate:</strong> News/data and betting activity both confirm sector is in the middle of a significant cost resetting.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inflation</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core inflation running in the low-3% range:</strong> FRED and prediction market align here; disinflation trend modest but not enough for cuts without labor distress. Watch for serial CPI misses or policy mistakes as key late-Q1 market mover.</li>
<li><strong>Energy, food, and shelter still sticky:</strong> Oil and input prices, especially if geopolitics flare, will slow disinflation. Shelter/OER measures to remain stubborn.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Sectors &amp; Thematic Views</h2>
<h3>Equities: S&amp;P 500, Tech, and Rate Sensitives</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>S&amp;P 500: Range-bound/choppy:</strong> Market expects S&amp;P to close 2026 close to 7,000, with mild upside but significant risk of a 6,500-6,800 floor if funding, rates, or conflict surprise to the downside.</li>
<li><strong>Tech: Risk of rotation away from mega-caps:</strong> AI and chip sector earnings are massive upcoming catalysts, but Apple could underperform further amid “leadership vacuum” narratives. AI overheat risk, layoffs, and anti-monopoly legal headlines could add pressure to big tech.</li>
<li><strong>Banking/Financials:</strong> Funding and rates volatility present; Big Bank earnings will be an early barometer of 2026 credit and deposit stability.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Energy/Commodities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oil: Event-driven upside, but not panic:</strong> Frequent risk flares (Iran, Israel) are keeping spot oil above long-run trend, but recession fears and ample supply have capped big moves YTD. Major commodities will remain sensitive to shipping security, Middle East escalation, and funding stability in emerging markets.</li>
<li><strong>Gold/Silver: Defensive + volatility hedge:</strong> Patient capital may bid up gold further if debt ceiling or Mideast conflicts escalate; both assets favored in geopolitical stress, especially with real yields softening.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Housing, Real Estate, and Mortgages</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rates stay elevated, but the peak is in:</strong> 30yr mortgage rates seen below 6.5% soon. Key metro home price indices are flat/down slightly; new home supply lagging, which supports floor on prices. REITs and MBS remain highly sensitive to Fed signaling and fiscal path.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Crypto</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin &amp; Majors: Macro + ETF flows dominate:</strong> BTC halving supply impact plus positive spot ETF flows underpin strong YTD performance. Tail risk from regulator/litigation headlines, but capital allocation from S&amp;P constituents, corporate treasuries, and even smaller countries is incrementally supportive.</li>
<li><strong>Altcoins and DeFi: Fickle flows, persistent hacks:</strong> Prediction markets reflect both continued rotation and a wave of new token launches through H1, but hack/technology risk is far from priced in.</li>
<li><strong>Stablecoins:</strong> Market structure and regulatory direction ambiguous; no clear existential threat but no regulatory closure either.</li>
</ul>
<h3>AI, Tech Supply Chain, &amp; Semiconductors</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA and AI infra in spotlight:</strong> Key GPU suppliers’ earnings in Feb–Mar will define 2026’s “AI bull vs. AI cost reset” narrative—expect volatility.</li>
<li><strong>Apple, Microsoft, Google:</strong> AI product cycle dominates sentiment—leadership changes, App Store downloads, and supply chain constraints will all move names on earnings.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Defense &amp; Geopolitics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event risk remains real:</strong> If Israel/Iran or US/Iran direct strikes materialize, look for upward spikes in oil, gold, defense equities, US rates, and safe-haven flows.</li>
<li><strong>Ukraine/Gaza:</strong> Ceasefire outcomes could rapidly shift the risk premium across energy and defense sensitive assets.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Company/Single Name Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earnings Risk:</strong> Q4 earnings for banks, tech, homebuilders, and diversifieds to drive early Q1 narrative—surprises are likely in commercial loan portfolios and in consumer hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Legal, Antitrust, and Executive turnover:</strong> High probability of management shakeups in major tech (AAPL, GOOG), ongoing antitrust litigation risk for platforms (Apple, Amazon, Google).</li>
<li><strong>IPO Pipeline:</strong> Significant expected action among high-profile AI, fintech, and infra suppliers—timing/sizing highly sensitive to market sentiment and liquidity.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Positioning &amp; Second-Order Effects</h2>
<ul>
<li>Defensive posture, with skew to quality and cash-generative names, remains prudent pending fiscal outcome and earnings cycle clarity.</li>
<li>Value in core rates, TIPS/breakevens, and gold as macro hedges.</li>
<li>Lower beta, capital-light tech, and recession-resistant sectors likely outperform if labor market cracks.</li>
<li>Selective energy/commodities for event/vol spike, but avoid EM outliers until post–US debt/budget window.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
